    <title>Australia Council announces new publishing subsidies</title>
    <description>The Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts is excited to announce a new structure for its publishing subsidies which will provide publishers with greater flexibility and recognise the contribution and track record of Australia&amp;rsquo;s small and medium sized publishers.

Under the new Publishing Program Grants, which commences in 2012, publishers will apply for annual funding towards their literary publishing program rather than applying for funding for individual titles.

Special Publishing Grants will also be available for &amp;lsquo;one-off&amp;rsquo; titles or a series of titles as part of a larger, innovative publishing project. A publisher can apply for up to $50,000 for support for editing, manuscript development, production, digital conversion, permission fees or any large costs, associated with the publication of one-off &amp;lsquo;special&amp;rsquo; titles.

The new structure comes as the result of extensive industry consultation, which was informed by the report, A case for literature, which examined the effectiveness of Australia Council publishing subsidies between 1995 and 2005.

Whilst the report highlighted the vital impact the Literature Board&amp;rsquo;s publishing subsidies program, it also made recommendations for ways it could improve its support for the publishing industry.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;ldquo;Overwhelmingly the publishers we spoke to supported the report&amp;rsquo;s recommendations, in particular the move away from title-by-title funding to support via a program grant,&amp;rdquo; says Dennis Haskell, Chair of the Literature Board.

&amp;ldquo;This is important feedback for the Board to receive and we&amp;rsquo;re very pleased to become more effective in supporting the release of important, outstanding Australian writing.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been really rewarding to work with the industry on this program, to see how engaged they are with us and to see how important Australia Council publishing subsidies are,&amp;rdquo; says Dennis.

The application closing date for Publishing Program Grants and Special Publishing Grants is 30 March 2012. Application forms will be available on www.australiacouncil.gov.au from early January.



A case for literature: The effectiveness of subsidies to Australian publishers 1995-2005 and a full response from the Literature Board is available here.

    <title>New funding for artists to build a creative Australia</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts is pleased to launch the Creative Australia Artists Grants, a five year program of funding which delivers to artists the Federal Government&amp;rsquo;s budget commitment of $10 million in new funding to the arts.
The program will support artists, including young and emerging artists, across all artforms to deliver new artistic works, undertake fellowships and create additional presentations to Australian audiences over the next five years, commencing this year, as part of the Government&amp;rsquo;s commitment to invest in a creative Australia.

&amp;ldquo;The Creative Australia Artists Grants are about giving artists the resources and the time to develop their creative vision,&amp;rdquo; says Kathy Keele, CEO of the Australia Council.

&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s also about giving Australian audiences access to new and diverse creative experiences.&amp;rdquo;

Among the new opportunities available will be the New Art initiative which will be open to artists of all backgrounds. Through this initiative the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Inter-Arts Office will deliver grants for 16 large scale projects that take creative risks and explore new ways of engaging the Australian public with contemporary, experimental art.

The Australia Council will also award 10 fellowships for established artists and 13 fellowships for young and emerging artists in a major new initiative to support outstanding artists working across the sector and across Australia.

&amp;ldquo;These fellowships will support the career development of artists across artforms, whether they live in the cities or regional and rural Australia,&amp;rdquo; says Kathy. &amp;ldquo;They offer artists the precious gift of time and space to create inspiring and ambitious work.&amp;rdquo;

A range of presentation initiatives to help build and connect with audiences will also be available from mid 2012. These grants will support a range of activities across all artforms including exhibiting, touring, recording, publishing, presenting and promoting existing or new activities.

Federal Minister for the Arts, Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean, welcomed the launch.

&amp;ldquo;The Federal Government is committed to providing opportunities for artists across the country and to giving all Australians access to the arts,&amp;rdquo; says Minister Crean.

&amp;ldquo;The Creative Australia Artists Grants will fund up to 150 additional artistic works, presentations and fellowships over five years and that&amp;rsquo;s an important contribution to the vitality of our arts sector.&amp;rdquo;

The Australia Council will promote the new opportunities as they become available through its funding forums, marketing campaigns and online resources. Council will focus on attracting applications from artists facing access barriers such as artists with a disability, artists from non-English speaking and culturally diverse backgrounds, and artists in regional and remote areas.

    <title>Expressions of interest open for redevelopment of the Australian Pavilion in Venice</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts invites expressions of interest (EOI) from Australian registered architects and architectural practices for the redevelopment of the Australian Pavilion in Venice, Italy.
The Australia Council announced its intention to redevelop the pavilion at the opening of the 2011 Australian exhibition at the Venice Biennale in June. The call for Expressions of Interest is the first step in a two-stage process to select an architect to develop the new pavilion.

&amp;ldquo;The call for EOI marks the start of this exciting project,&amp;rdquo; said James Strong AO, Chair of the Australia Council. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a great deal of interest in it and I&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt that come 2015, we&amp;rsquo;ll be opening an excellent example of contemporary Australian architecture whilst delivering a first class exhibition space, appropriate to the art of today and tomorrow.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a complex project made even more so by its limited space and its setting in the unique city of Venice,&amp;rdquo; continued James. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re looking for an architect who can work in this environment and deliver a public exhibition space that will best represent our artists on this significant world stage.&amp;rdquo;

The EOI stage is an opportunity for architects to provide the selection panel with a clear, concise and considered demonstration of their credentials for a project of this nature.

Following evaluation of the EOI by the selection panel, a shortlist of candidates will be invited to submit a comprehensive tender proposal, based on a detailed design brief, to demonstrate how the project requirements will be successfully implemented.

&amp;ldquo;The Australian Institute of Architects has endorsed the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s selection process as being consistent with our competition guidelines,&amp;rdquo; said Ross Clark, the Institute&amp;rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer. &amp;ldquo;This is a challenging project on many fronts, but we are confident this competitive process will lead to the appointment of an architect who will deliver an inspiring and creative building, of which all Australians can be proud.&amp;rdquo;

The selection panel will comprise: Mr Luca Belgiorno-Nettis AM (Joint Managing Director of Transfield Holdings, Chair, Biennale of Sydney); Mr Doug Hall AM (Australian Commissioner, Venice Biennale 2011, a former Director, Queensland Art Gallery and the Gallery of Modern Art, 1987-2007); Ms Kathy Keele (CEO, Australia Council for the Arts); Mr Simon Mordant (Australian Commissioner, Venice Biennale 2013, Chair, Museum of Contemporary Art); and Mr Brian Zulaikha (President, Australian Institute of Architects and Director, Tonkin Zulaikha Greer Architects.)

The new pavilion is due to be completed for the opening of the 56th International Art Exhibition in June 2015. The project is managed by the Australia Council with capital costs raised by the private sector. The appointed architect may be required to work with an Italian firm, to be appointed by the Australia Council.


EOI submissions are due Friday 7 October 2011.
The appointment date for the architect is yet to be announced.

    <title>5th World Summit on Arts and Culture wraps up as Chile takes the baton for 2014</title>
    <description>The 5th World Summit on Arts and Culture concluded yesterday, generating a range of international initiatives to support arts practice and policymaking in Australia and internationally

Yesterday also marked the official handover to the Chilean National Council for Culture and the Arts, the host of the 6th World Summit on Arts and Culture, 13-16 January 2014.

The 5th World Summit, co-hosted by the Australia Council for the Arts and the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies (IFACCA), was held at the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre, Australia on 3-6 October and attracted 501 delegates from 72 countries.

The theme of the Summit, Creative Intersections, was explored by over 80 speakers who provoked wide-ranging debate around the role of innovative government policy in facilitating intersections between the arts and other sectors for the benefit of the broader community, including health and well-being, education, environmental action, business, international aid, social inclusion and digital technologies.

&amp;ldquo;The Australian arts and culture sector has gained enormously from our hosting of the Summit both in terms of information sharing and the creation of international networks,&amp;rdquo; said Kathy Keele, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts. &amp;ldquo;With the generous support of the Australian Federal Government, and our partners, Arts Victoria, the ABC, the University of Melbourne, the Asia-Europe Foundation, City of Melbourne, the Commonwealth Foundation, Creative New Zealand, and Tourism Victoria, as well as a range of other partners, we have created a unique and truly global event of which Australia can be proud&amp;rdquo;.

&amp;ldquo;The Summit has strongly reinforced the value of international networking between leaders in arts and cultural policy making,&amp;rdquo; said Alan Davey, Chair of IFACCA and CEO of Arts Council England. &amp;ldquo;It has also provided delegates and members of IFACCA with a myriad ideas for ways to better support partnerships and networking between artists, arts organisations and other sectors of society in Australia, the Pacific, Asia and the rest of the world&amp;rdquo;.

Publication of a final research report: Creative Partnerships: Intersections between the arts, culture and other sectors will be available in early 2012 as well as a compilation of the best practice case studies and papers presented at the Summit.

    <title>Arts Geeks in NBN hubs</title>
    <description>Get involved in Brunswick (VIC) and Armidale (NSW)

Early November sees the launch of the NBN Geek in Residence project in both Brunswick (VIC) and Armidale (NSW). This pilot program by the Australia Council for the Arts sees Julian Stadon and Alex Parker take up residence in Armidale and Brunswick respectively for 6 weeks. Julian and Alex will become a new brand of friendly neighbourhood Geeks, assisting local artists and arts organisations in their first contact with the NBN.

For more information visit the NBN Geeks website at www.nbngeeks.net.

What is the NBN?

The NBN or National Broadband Network is a new high-speed internet connection/broadband network which will be rolled out nationally over the coming years.

What does the Geek In Residence Program involve?

Julian and Alex are looking to facilitate the production of digital Australian arts content and to collaborate and share these works between the NBN hub locations of Brunswick and Armidale. Julian and Alex will implement a program of workshops, private consultations and networking events to increase digital skills for artists and arts organisations local to both areas. A survey of potential participants and their needs will determine the content of workshops with a range of topics possible from simple blogging techniques to online video production and social media engagement and even possibly beyond into virtual communities, locative media and game development.

Timeframe

The residencies will commence in early November 2011 and will conclude mid December with a showcase event of works conceived through the program.

Who can get involved?

Artists and arts organisations living and/or working within Brunswick and close surrounds are encouraged to participate. The education and facilitation aspect of the program will cater to a range of digital skill-sets from those who have no digital aspects to their processes to those who are extremely experienced in the area. In terms of content production and commitment, there are also no limits. Julian and Alex will be able to facilitate production of something as simple as a one-off video, blog, or live-streaming of an event, to more complicated series of works.

Geeks/Technicians interested in establishing connections and collaborating with artists and arts organisations are also encouraged to participate.

What is the next step?

Send a brief expression of interest detailing your name, location, general area of artistic practice and current digital interests to your relevant Geek.


  Artists and arts organisations local to the Brunswick area and its surrounds should contact Alex Parker at alex[at]residentgeeks[dot]net

  Artists and arts organisations local to the Armidale area and its surrounds should contact Julian Stadon at julian[at]residentgeeks[dot]net

    <title>Brisbane to host Australian Performing Arts Market</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts announces that Brisbane Powerhouse has been awarded the tender for the Australian Performing Arts Market 2014, 2016 and 2018.

The Australian Performing Arts Market (APAM) is a biennial performing arts market for artists and programmers from Australia and around the world to discover new artists, find new collaborators and meet with fellow professionals.

With the existing delivery partnership due to conclude in 2012, the Australia Council initiated discussion with the sector and a scoping study to consider APAM&amp;rsquo;s future.

&amp;ldquo;Our consultation revealed a desire to extend the focus of APAM on buying and selling to include collaborations, partnerships and long term exchange. We want to ensure the market remains a strong attractor and springboard for international opportunities for Australian arts,&amp;rdquo; says Rose Hiscock, Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Executive Director of Arts Development. &amp;ldquo;Brisbane Powerhouse responded to our tender with a compelling vision for the next three market places.&amp;rdquo;

A significant shift in future APAMs is a greater emphasis on the place of Australian arts and our region in a global context. Future APAMs will be a market, a festival and an exchange.

&amp;ldquo;The exchange will go beyond promoting individual performances to international presenters,&amp;rdquo; says Rose. &amp;ldquo;It will set out to deepen their interest and knowledge in the contemporary performing arts of Australia and its neighbors &amp;ndash; not only selling individual shows, but also building a deeper relationship with Australia and its region.&amp;rdquo;

The market will run alongside the World Theatre Festival, a curated program dedicated to the performing arts of the Australasian/South East Asian Region, providing a clear point of difference between APAM and other markets, as well as an opportunity to gain insights into arts in Australia and its neighbours.

&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to be part of the future of APAM,&amp;rdquo; says Andrew Ross, Director Brisbane Powerhouse. &amp;ldquo;By aligning APAM with The World Theatre Festival, we will provide an opportunity for presenters to see full length works whilst being part of a vibrant public event that showcases Australia and our region.&amp;rdquo;

The 2012 APAM will be held at the Adelaide Festival Centre from Sunday 26 February - Thursday 1 March.

Since 1998 The Australia Council has partnered with Arts SA to deliver APAM, with Arts Projects Australia producing the event. The partnership has seen the event grow from 200 participants including 35 international delegates in its first year to 584 participants, with almost 200 international delegates across 26 countries in 2010.

&amp;ldquo;The Australia Council is enormously grateful to South Australia - the Government through Arts SA - as well as Arts Projects Australia, the Adelaide Festival Centre and the Adelaide Festival, for nurturing and shaping APAM. It has been the launching pad for so many artists into the international market. We recognise the significant commitment and passion that has made the event a success,&amp;rdquo; says Rose.

    <title>New arts projects through Korea-Australia Connection Initiative</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts and Korea Arts Management Service (KAMS), are delighted to announce the projects supported in the pilot year of the Korea-Australia Connection Initiative: Strange Fruit and Noreum Machi&amp;rsquo;s In the Shadow of the Dragon and Not Yet It&amp;rsquo;s Difficult and Wuturi&amp;rsquo;s AMPERS&amp;amp;ND.

The Korea-Australia Connection Initiative is a partnership between the Australia Council and the Korea Arts Management Service (KAMS) to support new collaborative projects involving performing artists and companies from Australia and Korea. It aims to encourage long-term creative exchanges and to build market knowledge, expertise and networks for artists, companies, and producers in both regions.

In its first year, Strange Fruit and Noreum Machi will collaborate on In the Shadow of the Dragon, a new performance work inspired by ritual and ceremony. Noreum Machi is a renowned Korean music and dance ensemble who re-create traditional forms to suit contemporary times. Strange Fruit produce and perform a unique style of work that fuses theatre, dance and circus, using an elevated medium. Through the collaboration, the two companies will explore new techniques and work with music, dance and design to develop an aurally and visually arresting performance experience.

Phillip Gleeson, Creative Director, Strange Fruit, says, &amp;ldquo;Strange Fruit are incredibly excited to collaborate with Noreum Machi. Their work is contemporary yet deeply grounded in the practice of shamanism. Together, we will push the physical and gestural landscape to create a unique performance outcome.&amp;rdquo;

Juhong Kim, Artistic Director, Noreum Machi, says, &amp;ldquo;Noreum Machi is a Korean traditional music ensemble that gives highly theatrical performances. We expect its collaboration with Australian company Strange Fruit, which has emerged as a leader in street performance and physical theatre with its unique ways of expression, to reinvent the theatrical originality of Korean traditional music, produce world-class performances and open new avenues for performance.&amp;rdquo;

Not Yet It&amp;rsquo;s Difficult and Wuturi will produce AMPERS&amp;amp;ND, an international collaboration involving music, dance and physical theatre artists. Not Yet It&amp;#39;s Difficult is highly regarded for its approach to intercultural theatre practice, physical performance, multimedia theatre and site-specific installation. Wuturi specialise in traditional forms of music-driven theatre and dance. They will work together with Elision, a contemporary music ensemble, who bring their research into instrumental gestures to the project.

David Pledger, Artistic Director, Not Yet It&amp;rsquo;s Difficult says, &amp;ldquo;As an artist, collaboration for me is about creating something new, something other than what I would make on my own. An international collaboration amplifies this space as it forces the artist to consider their process in an inter-cultural frame and pretty much challenge every aspect of it. For NYID, Wuturi and Elision, this is the promise of AMPERS&amp;amp;ND.&amp;rdquo; Claire Sung, Producer, Wuturi , agrees: &amp;ldquo;I am ready to dive into the sea where all the treasures are hidden and waiting to be found.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;The Australia Council is enormously proud of this partnership with KAMS and we are delighted to share the collaborative journey the companies will undertake,&amp;rdquo; says Collette Brennan, Director, Market Development.

    <title>Julie Lomax appointed as new Director, Visual Arts</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts today announced the appointment of Julie Lomax as its new Director, Visual Arts.
Currently the Director of Visual Arts, London Region, for the Arts Council England, Julie will commence in her new role in February 2012. As Director, Visual Arts, Julie will be responsible for providing leadership to the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Visual Arts section and will be the senior advisor to its Visual Arts Board, implementing its decisions and providing key links between the Australia Council and the Visual Arts sector.

&amp;ldquo;I am looking forward to joining my new colleagues at the Australia Council for the Arts,&amp;rdquo; said Julie &amp;ldquo;It will be a privilege to work with artists and arts organisations in Australia&amp;rsquo;s dynamic and vibrant visual arts sector and I hope the knowledge and contacts I can bring will foster new partnerships and enhance Australia&amp;rsquo;s already prominent position on the international art scene.&amp;rdquo;

Julie, who originally trained as an artist at Chelsea School of Art, has over 10 years experience in arts management. Nominated as one of the 30 most powerful people in the art world on The Times&amp;rsquo; Art Power list 2010, Julie is also a panel member for the Fourth Plinth Commission in Trafalgar Square, Olympic Park art commissions, and is a steering group member for Art on the Underground.

&amp;ldquo;I am delighted Julie has accepted the role as Director, Visual Arts,&amp;rdquo; said Kathy Keele, CEO, Australia Council. &amp;ldquo;Her experience as a practitioner, advocate, creative producer, and most recently as one of the UK&amp;rsquo;s leading arts managers and administrators, will be of significant value to the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Visual Arts program to support the sector.&amp;rdquo;

Professor Ted Snell AM, Chair, Visual Arts Board commented: &amp;ldquo;Julie brings a wealth of experience from undertaking a similar role with the Arts Council England and comes with a commitment to engage collaboratively with the robust and exciting Australian visual arts sector.

&amp;ldquo;She is keen to collaborate with colleagues within the Australia Council, and more broadly in the sector, to learn more and to understand the particular conditions of practice for the arts that have shaped the work of Australian artists and the structures that support them. This will be an exciting period in which we will all learn a great deal. Her arrival coincides with a challenging period for the sector where her fresh eyes, deep commitment and solid base of expertise will be invaluable.&amp;rdquo;

Julie takes over from Kon Gouriotis OAM who has been in the role for the past three years, during which time he led the Visual Arts Board&amp;rsquo;s evaluation of the Visual Arts and Craft Strategy program and a review of its multi-year funded Key Organisations. Kon leaves the Australia Council at the end of November 2011 to take up the position of Director of the Australian Centre of Photography (ACP).

    <title>Distinguished poet recognised with emeritus award</title>
    <description>The Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts is pleased to announce Australian poet Robert Gray as the recipient of this year&amp;rsquo;s $50,000 Australia Council Writers&amp;rsquo; Emeritus award.

A poet, memoirist, editor, anthologist and book reviewer, Robert Gray has been awarded a number of Premier&amp;#39;s Prizes and, in 1990, was the recipient of the Patrick White Award.

His first collection, Creekwater Journal, was released in 1973 and while it gained him instant acclaim, he has tirelessly revised it, with all of these poems now being either substantially rewritten or discarded. The title points to his interest in the Australian landscape, both in itself and as a way of understanding ourselves, a fascination now synonymous with his work.

He has since released a further seven collections and many editions of Selected Poems, both in Australia and overseas and enjoyed the high esteem of writers and critics throughout the world.

&amp;ldquo;Robert Gray&amp;rsquo;s poems put him in a rare class of world poets whose work is likely to survive into the next century and beyond,&amp;rdquo; says Dennis Haskell, Chair of the Australia Council Literature Board. &amp;ldquo;He is arguably the best read of all Australian poets and has written pieces which are widely regarded as modern classics, are much studied, but which also hold a broad popular appeal.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Gray has the best eye in Australian poetry and his work is notable for its sharp visual images - a &amp;lsquo;tomato stake patch&amp;rsquo; of yachts; a propped piano lid becomes an &amp;lsquo;urgent sail, far from home&amp;rsquo; and Venice&amp;#39;s Grand Canal &amp;lsquo;a swan with its throat stretched out&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; says Dennis. &amp;ldquo;His memoir of 2008, The Land I Came Through Last, is a work so lyrical it reads like a long prose poem.&amp;rdquo;

On reading his memoir, fellow writer Helen Garner felt compelled to contact Robert saying &amp;ldquo;Your book filled me with joy. I wanted it to go on forever, so I could keep living in your way of writing, clear and severe, astonishingly rich and beautiful, and full of a dry tenderness.&amp;rdquo;

Robert has been a writer-in-residence at the prestigious Meiji University in Tokyo and is a translator of poetry of the German poet, Joachim Sartorius. His own work has been translated into many languages, including full collections of his works in Holland, China and Germany.

In 2009 Robert was one of the first two poets selected by Australian Poetry to tour Ireland, Scotland and Northern England; the success of which has paved the way for further tours and a bourgeoning relationship between the poetry scenes of Australia and the UK.

In October this year Robert, along with Geoffrey Lehmann, released the pivotal compendium, Australian Poetry Since 1788. The nearly 1100 page anthology features a myriad of Australian voices, themes and styles of poetry, which are accompanied by detailed notes on many of the poets. It is the culmination of over three decades of Gray and Lehmann&amp;#39;s anthology work.

&amp;quot;This is the largest and most comprehensive anthology of Australian poetry ever published, and provides a fresh - and sometimes controversial - view of the practice of the poetry,&amp;rdquo; says Dennis.

&amp;ldquo;In this major collection and in his own work, he&amp;rsquo;s become an important force in the preservation of our poetic heritage. Gray has a deep and equal respect for the art form, the world and the reader. It is a delight to honour his work with the Australia Council Writer&amp;rsquo;s Emeritus Award.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;nbsp;

  The Australia Council Writers Emeritus award is presented at a ceremony at the Australia Council for the Arts at&amp;nbsp;6pm tonight.

  Chair of the Literature Board Dennis Haskell&amp;#39;s speech at the ceremony is now available to read.

    <title>Community Arts and Cultural Development Awards</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts celebrates the achievements of two outstanding artists with the announcement of the 2011 Australia Council Community Arts and Cultural Development Awards.

Victorian Based artist, Kharen Harper, receives the prestigious Ros Bower Award, worth $50,000, for an outstanding, life-long contribution to community arts and cultural development.

In a career spanning over 20 years, Kharen has worked extensively with women in correctional institutions, elderly survivors of Melbourne orphanages, children in foster care, marginalised young people from the City of Geelong as well as organisations including The AIDS Council, Moreland City Council and Comcare.

She is well known for her work with Somebody&amp;rsquo;s Daughter Theatre Company, which works inside womens&amp;rsquo; prisons, as well as with &amp;lsquo;at risk&amp;rsquo; youth in rural areas.

A gifted writer, director and performer, Kharen&amp;rsquo;s plays are respectful of the people and the issues they depict, but are known for delicately mixing the tragic with light hearted moments, making for memorable theatre experiences which create an understanding of the significant issues faced by some of society&amp;rsquo;s most isolated members

Since 2001 through the Highwater Theatre program, she has worked with young people in Albury/Wadonga who have been physically or emotionally damaged to a point where they are unable to attend school. Kharen&amp;rsquo;s infectious energy, compassion and artistic skills have led to remarkable results, with 80 percent of these young people returning to school and commencing their VCE or taking up apprenticeships

&amp;ldquo;Kharen&amp;rsquo;s work has pushed artistic boundaries and transformed the lives of many who have been a part of it,&amp;rdquo; says Deputy Chair of the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Community Partnerships Committee, Jeremy Smith. &amp;ldquo;Her ability to connect with people, to understand their background and encourage them to tell their story is nothing short of remarkable.&amp;rdquo;

Shakthi Sivanathan will also receive the Kirk Robson Award for the achievements of young Australian artists working with communities to produce art about social issues.

Shakthi is a founding director of CuriousWorks which he has since led to deliver a series of creative initiatives that have had sustainable and innovative outcomes for all Australians.

From 2005-2007 Shakthi lead The Migrant Project, which brought together 40 Sydneysiders with cultural and artistic ancestries from across the globe, in a series of live performances and forums. Garnering an audience of over 2,000 people, the project concluded in a feature film.

Shakthi developed a best-practice model for using digital media in a simple, positive, lasting manner in marginalised communities, which has led to long-term community projects in Western Sydney and remote Western Australia

More recently he has worked on The Stories Project, a program which provides a pathway for potential cultural leaders to become employed, professional, influential media makers on behalf of their community; and The Lanka Project, a multi-platform initiative of theatre, audiovisual and community projects bringing the lives of Sri Lankan &amp;ndash; Australians to the fore

&amp;ldquo;Shakthi&amp;rsquo;s work has focused on respectful collaboration with some of Australia&amp;rsquo;s most marginalised communities,&amp;rdquo; says Jeremy Smith. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s also continually provided artistically innovative examples of the use of traditional and digital distribution methods for the ongoing sharing of contemporary, untold, Australian stories.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;nbsp;

  The Australia Council Community Arts and Cultural Development Awards are presented tonight at the Melbourne Town Hall at 6pm.

    <title>The Australia Council congratulates Geoffrey Rush on being named Australian of the Year</title>
    <description>The Australia Council congratulates Geoffrey Rush on being named Australian of the Year.

&amp;ldquo;This is a great endorsement of the role Australian artists play in our society,&amp;rdquo; says Kathy Keele, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts. &amp;ldquo;As Australian of the Year, Geoffrey will bring an artist&amp;rsquo;s perspective to important social issues and will help to tell those stories.&amp;rdquo;

With an already passionate dedication to the Australian theatre and film world, Geoffrey will use his role as Australian of the Year to improve the visibility and credibility for Australian theatre and film. It&amp;rsquo;s also an important opportunity to highlight the strength of Australian arts, as well&amp;nbsp; issues that face the sector such the difficulty for artists in maintaining careers.

&amp;ldquo;Australians are passionate arts goers and they understand the important role the arts play in our society,&amp;rdquo; says Kathy. &amp;ldquo;But maintaining a career as an artist is still extremely difficult, so to have someone such as Geoffrey named Australian of the Year is a wonderful opportunity to put the spotlight on all our talented artists and to generate understanding and support for what they do.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;With the approach of the new National Cultural policy, 2012 is well on its way to becoming the year of Australian arts.&amp;rdquo; says Kathy.

A consummate theatre actor, he has continued to choose roles that intrigue and challenge him, as opposed to star vehicles.&amp;nbsp; This unpretentious, playful and collegiate approach to working on the Australian stage, has earned him as much respect within the sector as the trophies he has won.

Amongst much else, Rush is known for his long association with Belvoir (Company B), where he took an active interest in up-and-coming theatre artists, acting as patron of Belvoir&amp;rsquo;s B Sharp season of independent theatre works for 12 years. His generosity with both time and talent is well-known within the arts sector. During seasons at Belvoir, he could often be found after performances mixing with actors, crew and audience members, and talking with emerging artists about their work. &amp;nbsp;

Rush is an ambassador for the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and UNICEF Australia, and last year he was appointed the foundation president of the newly-formed Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts. Rush&amp;nbsp; is also patron of the Melbourne International Film Festival, Toowoomba&amp;#39;s Empire Theatre Foundation, the Spina Bifida Foundation Victoria.

    <title>Contribute to the Australia council review now through the online survey</title>
    <description>The Chairs of the independent Australia Council Review have launched an online survey to identify a broad range of views about the relevance and support the agency provided to the arts, culture and creative industries.
Arts Minister Simon Crean said many &amp;ldquo;The Australia Council has a proud history of supporting artists and organisations to develop their talent and showcase their work to national and international audiences.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Chairs of the Review, Mr Angus James and Ms Gabrielle Trainor, want to follow on from the public consultation and ask the sector if the original purpose of the Australia Council remains relevant today.

&amp;ldquo;As part of their review, the Chairs have developed an online survey over the last few weeks which is designed to draw out the sector&amp;rsquo;s views and to see what changes, if any, they would like to see made to the Australia Council.

Mr James and Ms Trainor strongly encouraged interested parties to respond to the online survey and said it was important that stakeholders from across all art forms, industry groups and those with an interest in the agency provide feedback on what aspects of the agency can be improved.

This questionnaire should only take around 8-10 minutes and can only be completed in one sitting. The survey is being undertaken for the Review by TNS Social Research on behalf of the Australian Government&amp;rsquo;s Office for the Arts.

The survey closes at 5pm AEDT, Friday 9 March 2012. &amp;nbsp;

    <title>Visual arts awards for two extraordinary careers</title>
    <description>Two outstanding careers in the visual arts are today recognised with the Australia Council Visual Arts Laureate Award and Laureate Medal, at a ceremony at Canberra&amp;rsquo;s National Gallery of Australia.Leading Australian contemporary artist Fiona Hall receives the $40,000 Australia Council Visual Arts Laureate Award, acknowledging her exceptional achievements as a visual artist and her outstanding contribution to the development of Australian art.

&amp;ldquo;Fiona is an exceptional artist who transforms ordinary everyday objects to address big ideas such as globalisation, consumerism, colonialism and natural history,&amp;rdquo; says Professor Ted Snell, Chair of the Australia Council Visual Arts Board. &amp;ldquo;She does it with skill, with wit, with insight and with amazing energy,&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Her work has become iconic in the lexicon of contemporary Australian art practice; her magically transformed sardine cans, her transmogrified knitted video tape and her re-imagined bank notes are instantly recognisable and unanimously embraced as works of great beauty,&amp;rdquo; says Professor Snell.

Fiona Hall first emerged on the arts scene in the 1970s as a photographer, but during the 1980s transitioned to using a diverse range of art forms. Her ever-growing repertoire includes sculpture, painting, installation, garden design and video.

With a career now spanning four decades, and continuing unabated, her work is represented in every major public art collection in Australia. She has been included in many national and international exhibitions and undertaken numerous sought after residencies. &amp;nbsp;

She won the prestigious Contempora 5 Art Award at the National Gallery of Australia in 1997, she was included in the 2010 Sydney Biennale and Last year was awarded the Artist Award from the Melbourne Art Foundation in recognition of her achievement in the visual arts through a comprehensive body of work.

Director of the National Gallery of Australia, Ron Radford AM receives the Laureate Medal for his outstanding contribution to the development of the Australian cultural sector.

In over thirty years of working in the art museum profession in Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, he has been responsible for the acquisition of approximately 15,000 works of art and has personally curated almost sixty exhibitions. He is also the author of numerous catalogues and books and was appointed Australian Commissioner for the 1999 Venice Biennale.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;ldquo;Ron is indeed larger than life, he has an exceptional ability to project his vision for a Gallery to enthuse those around him,&amp;rdquo; says Professor Snell. &amp;ldquo;His support of Australian art and Australian artists has been quite simply phenomenal, throughout his career many have benefited from his good counsel, his generosity and his advocacy.&amp;rdquo;

Ron has served on many national and state boards and committees, including five years as a member of the Australia Council and Chair of the Visual Arts/Craft Board (from 1997&amp;ndash; 2002). He was a foundation member of the National Portrait Gallery Board from 1997 to 2005 and its Deputy Chair from 2001 to 2005.

&amp;ldquo;Fiona Hall and Ron Radford are exceptional individuals whose commitment and energy is renowned,&amp;rdquo; concludes Professor Snell. &amp;ldquo;Both are consummate professionals and both are enthusiasts whose passion is transmitted to others with great energy and panache through their work.&amp;rdquo;


  The Australia Council Visual Arts Laureate Award and Laureate Medal are presented today, at a ceremony at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra.

    <title>Highest accolade for a unique Australian musician</title>
    <description>The Australia Council Don Banks Music Award, the most valuable individual music award in the country, is tonight awarded to Jon Rose, for his outstanding and continued contribution to Australian music.For nearly four decades, Jon has been at the sharp edge of new and improvised music in Australia. He is a violinist, instrument maker, software developer, composer, performer, provocateur and innovator. He has recorded a vast and impressive body of work and has performed and exhibited around the world.


&amp;#8220;Jon&amp;#39;s influence as a musical maverick and innovator is appreciated worldwide,&amp;#8221; says Matthew Hindson, Chair of the Australia Council Music Board, who presents the award tonight at the Museum of Western Australia. &amp;#8220;Jon has an uncanny ability to see the musicality of everyday activities, situations and objects. He finds music in everything and encourages us to see that the world is musical.&amp;#8221;

He is well known for playing wire fences, a talent that began with the premise &amp;#8216;instead of this great country of ours being traversed by millions of miles of fencing, it is in fact covered with millions of miles of string instrument, and we all just gotta get out there and play it!&amp;#8217;

With The Great Fences of Australia Jon has travelled across every state and territory, playing and recording the unique sounds of hundreds of fences, including the well-known &amp;#39;Dog Fence&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Rabbit-Proof Fences&amp;#39;.

&amp;#8220;While Jon is known as a composer or a violinist, he is in the broadest possible sense, an artist,&amp;#8221; says Matthew. &amp;#8220;His work is not divided into categories but flows from one end of the spectrum to the other, moving freely between art forms.&amp;#8221;

Jon Rose started playing violin at the age of seven, but quickly disregarded formal training and has since spent his time exploring everything conceivable, and beyond, that can be done with a violin. This includes building of a range of previously unimagined instruments such as the double piston, triple neck wheeling violin; the 19-string cello and the bicycle-powered double violin.

His exploration of the violin is captured in his life&amp;#8217;s work, the Relative Violin Project which, beyond instrument making, has involved writing books, radiophonic works, films, the development of extended string techniques, the founding of a semi-fictional violin museum (The Rosenberg Museum), and a plethora of large scale multi-media performances often placing the violin outside of the concert hall.

Jon is committed to encouraging a broader understanding of music. In 1977, he started Australia&amp;#8217;s first musician run collective for the promotion and recording of improvised music, Fringe Benefit. In 2002 he set up the Australia Ad Lib website for the ABC, an interactive record of, and guide to Australia&amp;#39;s diverse music-making.

He is also well known for his work with interactive electronics, particularly with his development of the interactive violin bow, or K-Bow. He has turned sports into musical and mixed-media compositions such as netball games (Team Music), pieces for kites and kayaks, a giant environmental ball piece (Sphere of Influence) and developed a whole chamber orchestra of bicycle-powered musical instruments, Pursuit, which will have a revival in Australia in 2013 as part of the Centenary of Canberra celebrations.

&amp;#8220;Jon is a global artist, but one with a deep understanding of Australia; it&amp;#8217;s culture, history and physical landscape, which he brings to his work and shares with the world,&amp;#8221; says Matthew. &amp;#8220;He stands as a role model of courage and persistence for talented artists on the fringes. It is a great honour for us to present him with the Australia Council Don Banks Music Award.&amp;#8221;



  The Australia Council Don Banks Music Award is presented at the Museum of Western Australia, tonight at 6:30pm, as part of the Tura New Music 2012 program launch.&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;
Video

To recognise Jon&amp;#39;s achievements the Australia Council commissioned a short video featuring samples of his work and tributes from&amp;nbsp;distinguished&amp;nbsp;members of the music and arts community.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

About the award

The Australia Council Don Banks Music Award is one of the top annual awards the Australia Council offers in recognition of Australian artists whose work represents outstanding achievement in their respective fields.

The Award is valued at $60,000 and is offered by the Council&amp;rsquo;s Music Board. The Board offers only one award annually to an individual artist.

The purpose of the Australia Council Don Banks Music Award is to honour an artist of high distinction who has made an outstanding and sustained contribution to Australia music over a period of many years.

    <title>Denton Corker Marshall Appointed Architects for New Venice Pavilion</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts today announced that one of Australia&amp;rsquo;s most highly regarded architectural practices, Denton Corker Marshall, will design the new Australian pavilion for the Venice Biennale, planned for completion in 2015.

&amp;nbsp;Denton Corker Marshall, whose credits include such landmark buildings as the Melbourne Museum, Museum of Sydney, Australian Embassies in Tokyo and Beijing, and the Stonehenge Visitor Centre in the UK, was unanimously selected from a shortlist of six Australian firms.


&amp;ldquo;Denton Corker Marshall was considered the outstanding choice to undertake this significant project,&amp;rdquo; said Chair of the Australia Council, James Strong AO. &amp;ldquo;We are inspired by their creative vision, confident in their ability and excited by the potential for a truly exemplary building all Australians will be proud of.&amp;rdquo;

Denton Corker Marshall&amp;rsquo;s concept for the pavilion is simple. As stated in their submission, the design is &amp;ldquo;to make a form of the utmost simplicity; a white box contained within a black box. The pavilion is envisaged as an object rather than a building; a presence that is simultaneously powerful and discreet within the heavily wooded gardens.&amp;rdquo;

John Denton, from Denton Corker Marshall said today: &amp;ldquo;Venice holds a special place in the arts and architecture worlds so it&amp;rsquo;s very exciting for us to win this project. I believe it will be a building that will proudly represent Australia and be recognised as a powerful, confident addition to the pavilions in the Giardini.&amp;rdquo;

The Venice Biennale is the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest and most prestigious event on the international contemporary arts calendar. Australia has been consistently represented at the event for more than three decades. It regularly attracts a quarter of a million visitors over its five months and last year over 192,000 attended the Australian pavilion&amp;rsquo;s exhibition.

Selection panellist Brian Zulaikha, President, Australian Institute of Architects said of the winning tender: &amp;ldquo;Denton Corker Marshall&amp;#39;s building is a striking, perhaps timeless addition to the Giardini. Handsome and sculpturally bold, its skilful simplicity creates an inspiring and limitless space for artists and audiences.&amp;rdquo;

Australia has had a site in the prestigious Giardini location since 1988 &amp;ndash; one of only 29 countries to have a permanent national presence &amp;ndash; where Phillip Cox designed our first pavilion as a temporary structure for the Arthur Boyd exhibition of that year. The new pavilion is due to be completed for the opening of the 56th International Art Exhibition, Venice Biennale 2015. The project, managed by the Australia Council, is estimated to cost approximately $6 million with all capital funds to be sourced from the private sector. Australia is the first country to redevelop its site in the Giardini.



  High resolution images of the new Australian Pavilion are available for media.&amp;nbsp;www.australiacouncil.gov.au/pavilion

    <title>A new agreement needed for women in theatre</title>
    <description>A new report, Women in Theatre, released today by the Australia Council for the Arts, offers the first detailed analysis of the representation of women in creative roles in the Australian theatre scene from the early 80s to today.

A key finding is that whilst the concerted policy and strategy interventions of the 80s and 90s saw improvements in the representation and support of women key creative roles throughout this period; over the past decade, there&amp;rsquo;s evidence that the situation has deteriorated.

The report, a key recommendation from the 2010 Women Director&amp;rsquo;s Forum, was commissioned through a partnership of the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Theatre and Major Performing Arts Boards. It draws upon data and commentary from reports on the issue of women in creative leadership compiled over the past 30 years, together with interviews with over 40 key industry figures.

Importantly, the report proposes a way forward through three strategies: more rigorous tracking of the state of the sector and any advances for women; greater board and senior management accountability for their track record; and vigilance, through all individuals taking responsibility for their decision-making.

The Australia Council has launched an online survey to gather responses to the report, the issues it raises and the three proposed strategies. Members of the theatre sector are encouraged to read the report and contribute their thoughts. Survey results, along with an upcoming focus group discussion, will enable the Australia Council and the sector to collaborate on further development of the strategies.

&amp;ldquo;The report confirms what we know instinctively - that there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;rsquo;silver bullet&amp;rsquo; solution,&amp;rdquo; says Stephen Armstrong, Chair of the Australia Council Theatre Board. &amp;ldquo;People commonly talk of gender quotas, but this has been shown to be ineffective.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s also clear that this isn&amp;rsquo;t isolated to the theatre sector,&amp;rdquo; says Stephen. &amp;ldquo;Many of the obstacles detailed in this report are the same ones faced by women in the private sector such as the burden balancing of career and family responsibilities which often falls to women, the lack of sustained organisational reporting and action, and the perception that this is not a problem.&amp;rdquo;

While the issue of gender equality in the theatre largely fell off the agenda in the early 2000s, it remerged in 2009, with public debate around the unusually low representation of women in creative roles within major theatre subscription seasons for 2010.

&amp;ldquo;Since 2009 the Australia Council has provided the sector with forum and roundtable opportunities to analyse state of play, and through the newly developed Creating Pathways reporting tool, we plan to collect meaningful data about how our theatre organisations are progressing with the issue,&amp;rdquo; says Stephen.

&amp;ldquo;What we need to ensure now is that this report is not an end in itself, but instead, a point of no return in improving the prospects for women creatives in Australian theatre.&amp;rdquo;

The report brings the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s research in this area up to the present day, and provides a basis for the theatre sector to reach agreement on future strategies to achieve and sustain some parity for women in creative leadership.

    <title>A life in music honoured with top Indigenous award</title>
    <description>The Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board is proud to present the $50,000 Red Ochre Award, Australia&amp;rsquo;s highest peer-assessed award for an Indigenous artist, to Western Aranda country musician Warren H Williams for his outstanding contribution to the Indigenous arts.The award is presented today at the 5th National Indigenous Arts Awards, held at the Sydney Opera House. Also presented is the inaugural $20,000 Dreaming Award, for a young and emerging Indigenous artist, awarded to Nakkiah Lui, a playwright from Western Sydney.

Two fellowships of $90,000 over two years are also announced, one going to musician Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu and the other to &amp;lsquo;digital native&amp;rsquo;, Jenny Fraser.

Warren H Williams is a singer, musician and song writer from Hermannsburg in Central Australia. While known widely as a country musician, he brings together many threads of the contemporary Australian sound, merging Aboriginal music with country and rock, bringing these musical genres onto a world stage.

&amp;ldquo;Warren plays a vital and unique role in the Australian music industry,&amp;rdquo; says Lee-Ann Buckskin, who was appointed Chair of the Australia Council ATSIA Board this week. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s a quiet achiever who not only shows young people the way to have a successful career in the music industry, but also dedicates his energy to issues of health, Aboriginal rights and the environment.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;Whenever he talks, people listen; and when he plays, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in the laneways of Melbourne, in youth centres in Alice Springs, or live on national television &amp;ndash; crowds are mesmerised by his music,&amp;rdquo; says Lee-Ann.&amp;nbsp;

The turning point for Warren&amp;rsquo;s career came when he joined with John Williamson to sing&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;Raining on the Rock&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the duet became an anthem for reconciliation and one of Australia&amp;rsquo;s most recognised country songs.

Warren&amp;rsquo;s achievements have been recognised through many awards including NAIDOC Artist of the Year in 2006, the Country Music Centenary Medal from the Country Music Association of Australia in 2004, and a Golden Guitar with John Williamson &amp;amp; Amos Morris for &amp;lsquo;Australia Is Another Word For Free&amp;rsquo; in 2009.

To date, Warren has released nine albums. His latest offering is a move away from country music to a language album Winanjjara, or &amp;lsquo;song man&amp;rsquo; in Warumungu language. It was recorded with the song men of Tennant Creek and sung in two of his maternal ancestors&amp;rsquo; languages: Warumungu and Western Aranda.

With his Red Ochre prize money, Warren plans to go to the US country music capital of Nashville to create an album.

&amp;ldquo;If there is anyone who deserves to be acknowledged for his integrity, commitment and compassion towards his fellow Aboriginal artists and community, it is Warren H Williams,&amp;rdquo; says Lee-Ann.

Dreaming Award recipient Nakkiah Lui is a 25-year-old Gamilaroi and Torres Strait Islander woman who grew up in Western Sydney. A passionate playwright, she draws heavily from her own life and community in the Mount Druitt area, which has a large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. She wrote her first play while studying in Canada as a way to share her culture with an international community.

Nakkiah is currently a resident playwright at Belvoir, Sydney. The award prize of $20,000 allows her to continue her work at Belvoir with her mentor; director and dramaturg Andrea James.

She will write a new play that will receive development assistance, including a staged reading at Belvoir in 2012. Nakkiah aims to explore the role of an Aboriginal Community Liaison Officer&amp;rsquo;s conflicts while working within the police force.&amp;nbsp; The Dreaming Award money will give her the resources to do the required research.

&amp;ldquo;Nakkiah is a talented emerging playwright with a unique voice,&amp;rdquo; says Lee-Ann. &amp;ldquo;She exudes enthusiasm about her work and future career. Her vision for a play examining the tensions surrounding the role of Aboriginal Community Liaison Officer was both clear and compelling.

&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased to see the inaugural Dreaming Award presented to someone who will undoubtedly grow to be an important, Australian voice.&amp;rdquo;

Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu will use his fellowship to create a large-scale music and surround multi-screen sensory installation with imagery drawn from his homelands. Audiences of his new digital installation will be able to hear and smell the ocean, and experience the land and community of the remote Elcho Island.

Much of Jenny Fraser&amp;rsquo;s work as a screen-based visual artist, writer and curator defies categorisation. Through her fellowship she is set to challenge audiences again with her latest unusual storytelling project, Midden.

Midden will celebrate unsung heroes and previously unspoken events in a non-linear documentary. Jenny will use shells, along with screen-based and performance elements to enhance, reframe and remix stories, to create new ways of engaging audiences.&amp;nbsp;


  The&amp;nbsp;Australia&amp;rsquo;s premier Indigenous arts awards a presented

  Sunday, 27 May 2012 in the Utzon Room at the Sydney Opera House, 3.00 - 5.00pm.

  Audio and images from the event are available on request

  The National Indigenous Arts Awards are presented annually by the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board to outstanding Indigenous artists as nominated and selected by their peers.

  The awards are a celebration of the vibrancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts and culture and a snapshot of the outstanding diversity of Indigenous arts in Australia today.

    <title>Record delegation of Indigenous artists for FOPA</title>
    <description>The Australiaa Council for the Arts is proud to announce that 50 of Australia&amp;rsquo;s best Indigenous artists will attend the 11th Festival of Pacific Arts (FOPA) to be held in the Solomon Islands&amp;rsquo; capital, Honiara on July 1 &amp;ndash; 14.The Australian delegation of 50 artists, the largest ever to attend, represents an extensive range of Indigenous artforms and cultural practices, from dance and visual arts in the Torres Strait, desert reggae in Papunya, fabric design in the Tiwi to glassworks and poetry in Canberra.

Amongst the selected artists are the Tjupi Band, who are part of a new wave of Indigenous Australian reggae; the Chooky Dancers, widely known through&amp;nbsp;their previous work, Wrong Skin (Ngurrumilmarrmiryu)&amp;nbsp;and their appearance in the film Bran Nue Dae; Sharon Phineasa, whose passion for preserving culture through artistic expression leads to work across artforms including, painting, printmaking, collage, sculpture and carving; and singer/songwriter Jess Beck&amp;nbsp;creates a unique blend of pop, folk and jazz with her band.

The delegation was selected by the curatorial team of Marilyn Miller, Wesley Enoch, Vernon Ah Kee and Nadine McDonald, with the Queensland Theatre Company.

&amp;ldquo;I would like to thank the curatorial team for taking such care in selecting this year&amp;rsquo;s delegation,&amp;rdquo; says Kathy Keele, CEO of the Australia Council. &amp;ldquo;Each artist selected is an exceptional representative of their communities and their cultural traditions, both past and present.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;In full, we see a delegation that is rich in traditional arts and culture, but also displays the vibrancy of contemporary Indigenous arts practice,&amp;rdquo; says Kathy.

Held every four years since its inception in 1972, FOPA brings together 2,500 performers, artists and cultural practitioners from 27 countries and territories across the Pacific region. FOPA offers Indigenous peoples the opportunity to share customary practices in dance, music, food and crafts. The festival bridges the gap between traditional and contemporary cultural expression, while revitalising and reflecting on traditional arts and culture.

&amp;ldquo;Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts (ATSIA) board is proud to present and share the cultural expression of Indigenous Australia as part of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest gathering of Indigenous Pacific cultures,&amp;rdquo; says Lee-Ann Buckskin, Chair of the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s ATSIA board. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful opportunity to share the best of our culture with our Pacific brothers and sisters, as well as build connections beyond our borders.&amp;rdquo;

&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s more than an artistic and cultural exchange between individuals,&amp;rdquo; says Lee-Ann. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a social and political exchange between people, between cultures and between countries.&amp;rdquo;

This year, FOPA will reach a much wider audience than ever before, thanks to an innovative online strategy. A team, including a dedicated blogger, will create digital stories so that people who are unable to attend the festival in Honiara can witness daily activity.&amp;nbsp;

The Australian delegation also for the first time includes film and documentary makers who will both document and contribute creatively to the festival program.


  The Australian FOPA delegation will depart Brisbane for the festival 30 June. Artist bios are available from www.australiacouncil.gov.au/fopa.

  Podcasts, interviews and images from FOPA will be available from http://fopa.australiacouncil.gov.au which will launch 18 June.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    <title>Australian artists shine at dOCUMENTA (13)</title>
    <description>
  Thursday 7 June 2012 -&amp;nbsp;German Media Release&amp;nbsp;

  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

  The works of eight Australian visual artists will be on show at dOCUMENTA (13), one of the most prestigious events on the visual arts calendar, held in Kassel, Germany every five years. The strong and unprecedented Australian presence coincides with the 60th anniversary celebrations of Australian diplomatic relations with Germany.&amp;nbsp;Presented across venues and locations throughout Kassel,&amp;nbsp;documenta&amp;nbsp;has been showcasing cutting-edge contemporary visual arts from around the world since its inception in 1955. The last edition of documenta in 2007 attracted over 750,000 visitors from all over the world, including international collectors, gallery and museum directors and curators, and international press. &amp;nbsp;



  This is the largest ever contingent of Australian artists represented at dOCUMENTA (13). The artists are: Gordon Bennett, Simryn Gill, Fiona Hall, Stuart Ringholt, Margaret Preston (deceased), Doreen Reid Nakamarra (deceased), Warwick Thornton and Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri, and Australia-based Khadim Ali.&amp;nbsp;

  The celebration of Australian artists is the vision of dOCUMENTA (13) Artistic Director Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, a former&amp;nbsp;Biennale of&amp;nbsp;Sydney Artistic Director (2008), whose time with the Biennale inspired a passion for Australian artists.&amp;nbsp;

  Carolyn worked closely with indigenous curator Hetti Perkins to develop a distinct indigenous Australian element to the event, with four very different contemporary indigenous artists being represented, building an international appreciation of the strength and diversity of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest living culture. Christov-Bakargiev invited Perkins to join a core group of international curators to work alongside her as an Agent for dOCUMENTA (13).&amp;nbsp;

  &amp;ldquo;I am pleased to see such strong representation from Australia at dOCUMENTA (13), particularly as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations with Germany,&amp;rdquo; says Australian Ambassador to Germany Mr Peter Tesch. &amp;nbsp;

  &amp;ldquo;dOCUMENTA (13) will bring some of the best Australian contemporary visual artists and thinkers to an important global audience, enhancing the reputation of our artists and showcasing Australia&amp;rsquo;s contribution to global culture,&amp;rdquo; says Ambassador Tesch.

  Australia-based artist Khadim Ali will also participate and undertake a linked residency both before and during the event. &amp;nbsp;Australian writers, poets and scholars including Romaine Moreton, Jill Bennett and anthropologist Michael Taussig have been invited to contribute to the publication series accompanying dOCUMENTA (13), 100 notes &amp;ndash; 100 thoughts.

  &amp;ldquo;This is a wonderful moment for Australia to be so well represented at dOCUMENTA (13),&amp;rdquo; says Professor Ted Snell, Chair of the Australia Council&amp;rsquo;s Visual Arts Board. &amp;ldquo;One of the premier forums for contemporary art in the world, the strong cohort of Australian artists, writers and curators is evidence of the vitality and innovation that characterises Australian visual arts.&amp;rdquo;

  &amp;ldquo;Preceding the Sydney Biennale by a matter of weeks, it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent opportunity to showcase the achievements of Australian artists working locally and reaching global audiences,&amp;rdquo; says Professor Snell.

  The Australia Council for the Arts has supported dOCUMENTA (13) in partnership with the Australian Government&amp;rsquo;s nation branding program, Brand Australia, and the Australian Embassy in Berlin.


  dOCUMENTA (13) opens to the public on Saturday 9 June 2012 and runs for 100 days until 16 September 2012.&amp;nbsp;Event information and artist bios are available from http://d13.documenta.de/

    <title>Broadband Arts Initiative</title>
    <description>The Hon Simon Crean MP
Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government
Minister for the Arts

Media Release

PIONEERING ARTISTS TO EXPLORE NEXT GENERATION BROADBAND&amp;nbsp;

Four artistic teams will harness the unprecedented creative possibilities of high capacity broadband with $350,000 through the Australia Council’s Broadband Arts Initiative.

Arts Minister Simon Crean today announced the successful artists who will generate new art content for next generation broadband networks in Australia.&amp;nbsp;


  
    “The National Broadband Network is forging new possibilities for artists,” Mr Crean said.

    “It is broadening audiences for artists and providing new digital platforms for creating, sharing and presenting work.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    “I have been a constant advocate and proponent for this potential, arguing that the NBN is the highway.&amp;nbsp;

    “The creative industries are a key part of determining the vehicles that go on the highway. The access and applications are vital.&amp;nbsp;

    “Selected by a panel of practicing artists as well as leaders from the broadcast, creative and gaming industries, these teams are breaking creative boundaries with projects that are only possible as a result of high speed broadband infrastructure.

    “For example, Terrapin Puppet Theatre has received $100,000 to use high speed broadband to stage a live simultaneous performance of children’s show ‘Shadow Dreams’ to two audiences in different locations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    “In collaboration with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, and in a first for puppet performance, this project will feature live networked symphony performances in both locations,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    Festival director Marcus Westbury has received $86,000 for the Screen Portal Project which will connect artists and audiences in real-time interactions on high definition, life-size audio visual screens in public spaces in New South Wales and the Northern Territory, as part of the 2013 International Symposium on Electronic Arts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    The City of Whittlesea, Victoria has received $100,000 for ‘Stay or Leave’ an online public artwork that will reveal the impact of natural disaster. Using the National Broadband Network, this project will work with communities to create a sonic landscape which mirrors the rapidly changing circumstances of extreme events.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    Media artist Keith Armstrong has received $64,000 for ‘Long Time, No See?’ an online and installation artwork where the public will generate a vision for Australia’s long term future. This project connects with communities at early National Broadband Network release sites. &amp;nbsp;
  



  
    &amp;nbsp;

    “The initiative received enormous interest from artists and arts organisations across Australia, with more than 100 expressions of interest received,” Mr Crean said.&amp;nbsp;
  

  
    “Such a resounding sector response demonstrates the excitement from the arts community about the possibilities of high speed broadband and the National Broadband Network to allow artists to extend artistic form, rather than just distribute content.
  

  “I commend the Australia Council for giving artists this opportunity to innovate and to find new ways of connecting with audiences.”&amp;nbsp;

    <title>New Chair and Deputy Chair for Australia Council</title>
    <description>James Strong, outgoing Chair of the Australia Council for the Arts, says he and the Council members and management were all delighted with the appointment of Rupert Myer AM as Chair and Robyn Archer AO as Deputy Chair, as announced by Minister for the Arts, Simon Crean this morning.

The appointments provide a powerful combination of business skills and contemporary arts practice, which will guide the Australia Council through a critical phase as it approaches the outcomes of the Australia Council review and the unveiling of the National Cultural Policy.

Rupert Myer brings extensive leadership and planning experience gained across a number of arts and cultural advisory boards. He is a former Chairman of the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria Foundation and chaired the Commonwealth Government Enquiry into the Contemporary Visual Arts and Craft Sector.

Rupert is regarded as a leader in arts philanthropy and became a Member of the Order of Australia in January 2005 for service to the arts, for support to museums and galleries, and to the community through a range of philanthropic and service organisations.

“Rupert is an excellent choice to lead the Australia Council,” says James Strong, whose term as chair of the Australia Council comes to an end on 30 June. “He has exceptional business acumen and an instinct for good governance.”

“He understands the arts and, perhaps most importantly, believes in the centrality of the artist in the ecology of creative organisations, agencies and cultural institutions – a belief which is at the core of all the Australia Council does.”

Robyn Archer is a singer, writer, director, artistic director and public advocate of the arts. She has extensive experience as an artistic director of national and international arts festivals, including the Melbourne International Arts Festival.
&amp;nbsp;
She is currently the creative director of the Centenary of Canberra in 2013 and last year was program director for the 5th World Summit on Arts and Culture. In 2001 she was the artistic director of the inaugural 10 Days on the Island festival in Tasmania, instantly establishing it as the state’s premier cultural event.

“Robyn’s vision for the arts is inspiring,” says James. “And it’s her ability to turn that vision into something tangible that makes her one of the country’s truly great artistic leaders. Whether she’s singing, writing, directing a play or directing a festival, she consistently delivers excellence in art.”

Robyn succeeds John Denton in the role of Deputy Chair as his term concludes.

“It’s been a rewarding time serving as Chair of the Australia council,” says James. “The board is a diverse and talented one and I would like to thank the members for their support during my terms.”

“I leave knowing the organisation is in good hands, these are wonderful appointments.”

The arts community paid respect to James Strong at an event at the Australia Council last night. Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton of the Sydney Theatre Company noted James’ long term commitment to the arts. Other attendees included former arts Ministers Helen Coonan and Peter Garrett, who also read a statement from Simon Crean congratulating James on his term as Chairman.

    <title>New Chair Rupert Myer on the the contribution of the arts and culture</title>
    <description>The Australia Council&amp;#39;s new chair Rupert Myer champions the arts in The Australian.

Rupert Myer has championed the contribution the arts and culture make to Australia in his response to the article by Adam Creighton in The Weekend Australian (4-5 August). He argues that the creation of new artistic works and their presentation in arts institutions such as galleries, museums and theatres represents an important investment in our nation’s creative capital and a significant contribution to its GDP

He also pushes aside some of the misconceptions about arts funding in Australia, particularly the historical evolution, as well as the level of scrutiny placed upon Government investment in arts and culture, cautioning that if such misconceptions go unchecked they risk impacting upon policy decisions.

    <title>Hon Simon Crean MP - Media release - Reform of the Australia Council begins</title>
    <description>The Hon Simon Crean MP

Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government
Minister for the Arts


Arts Minister Simon Crean today announced the Australia Council for the Arts will have increased responsibility for a broader range of arts funding programs in the first steps of reforming the Council.

Speaking at the Australian Performing Arts Centres Association Conference, Mr Crean said that Playing Australia, Visions of Australia, Festivals Australia, the Contemporary Music Touring Program, Contemporary Touring Initiative and the Visual Arts and Craft Strategy will transfer to the Australia Council from the Office for the Arts.

“The recent Review of the Australia Council recommended a number of significant changes to the structure and operations of the Government’s major arts funding body,” Mr Crean said.

“Today’s announcement is the first step in readying the Australia Council for the challenges of an arts sector that is transforming, and to help deliver on the goals of the National Cultural Policy.

“Through these programs the Australia Council can increase the access of Australians living in regional and remote communities to high quality productions and exhibitions.”

The Chair of the Australia Council, Rupert Myer welcomed the announcement, saying that the Australia Council is perfectly placed to build on the success of the programs.

“This is a significant opportunity for the Australia Council to work more closely with a broader range of arts organisations and with venues throughout regional Australia,” Mr Myer said.

“The regional touring programs have a strong track record in delivering a great variety of high quality arts experiences sought by regional Australians – from contemporary music and circus, to theatre and exhibitions.

“Combining these programs under the Australia Council provides an important opportunity for national overview and we look forward to continuing to work with regional communities and the touring sector to deliver these experiences to regional audiences.

“These changes will provide the sector with a single source of funding with consistent application and reporting processes.

“We will work closely with the Office for the Arts to ensure a smooth transition of program management for recipients and applicants.”

Mr Crean said it was important that arts funding was peer-assessed.

“The Australia Council has a robust assessment process. Peer assessment by experts in the field will continue to be an important feature of the regional touring programs,” Mr Crean said.

The Australia Council will also manage and distribute the Australian Government‘s Visual Arts and Craft Strategy (VACS) funding contribution.

VACS is a joint initiative of the Australian, state and territory governments to support a strong and dynamic contemporary visual arts and craft sector.

Under the new administrative arrangement, the Government and jurisdictions will continue to play pivotal roles in negotiating the next VACS four-year funding package. Existing VACS recipients will receive funding according to agreements already in place.

Minister Crean also recently announced initial reforms to encourage increased levels of private sector and philanthropic support for the arts with the creation of a new organisation through the merger of Australia Business Arts Foundation (AbaF) and the Australia Council’s Artsupport Australia program.

The Government’s responses to further reforms recommended by the Review of the Australia Council and the Review of Private Sector Support for the Arts will be released as part of the National Cultural Policy later this year.

The transfer of regional touring programs will take place progressively over the next six months.

    <title>Vale Rosanne Fitzgibbon</title>
    <description>Vale Rosanne Fitzgibbon

Rosanne Fitzgibbon,&amp;nbsp; widely respected for her work in publishing, has passed away.

Sophie Cunningham, Chair of the Literature Board, said today that the Board would like to express its sadness on hearing of the death of&amp;nbsp; Rosie Fitzgibbon.

“Rosie was one of Australia&amp;#39;s most respected and admired literary editors. As well as working with dozens of its finest writers, Rosie shared her forty years of knowledge with us all through her active engagement with the publishing industry, and literary culture in general. She will be sorely missed.”

From Craig Munro and Sue Abbey
Editor Rosanne Fitzgibbon was widely respected for her work over four decades in fiction and non-fiction publishing. For sixteen years from 1989 Rosie was in-house fiction editor at the University of Queensland Press. She was not only responsible for literary fiction and nonfiction but also for scholarly publications in Australian literary studies.

In recent years Rosie was a freelance consultant lecturing on writing, editing and publishing, and conducting seminars and masterclasses for the Queensland Writers Centre as well as workshops for the Literature Board. She judged short story awards for the State Library of Queensland and participated in assessing, judging and editing all the One Book Many Brisbanes anthologies and competitions.

As a publishing editor she worked on numerous story collections, beginning in 1972 with the first work of fiction published by UQP: Michael Wilding’s Aspects of the Dying Process. Others included major collections by Thea Astley, Olga Masters, Lily Brett, Peter Carey, Kate Grenville, and Janette Turner Hospital. In 1998, with her sister Marion Halligan, she edited The Gift of Story: Three decades of UQP short stories.

As a fiction editor, Rosie published the work of many writers including Gillian Mears, Nick Earls, Mandy Sayer, Matthew Condon, Beverley Farmer, Venero Armanno, Rosie Scott, Victor Kelleher, Carmel Bird, Liam Davison, Marian Eldridge, John Clanchy, Barbara Hanrahan, Brian Castro, Nike Bourke, Gerard Windsor, Suzanne Edgar and Gerard Lee.

Rosie’s authors welcomed her warmly sympathetic, generous-spirited and constructive approach to their manuscripts and her unwavering commitment to literary excellence. She was always a book’s most passionate advocate throughout the publishing process from the earliest draft to the design, marketing and promotion of her titles.

Rosie served on boards and committees throughout Australia, including the Queensland Writers Centre, the Brisbane Writers Festival, Australian Book Review and the National Book Council. In 1992 she was awarded the inaugural Beatrice Davis Editorial Fellowship to work in book publishing in New York. Named after Angus &amp;amp; Robertson’s distinguished literary editor, this award is supported by the Literature Board, the Australian Publishers Association, the Institute of Professional Editors and the Australian publishing industry. Editor Rosanne Fitzgibbon was widely respected for her work over four decades in fiction and non-fiction publishing. For sixteen years from 1989 Rosie was in-house fiction editor at the University of Queensland Press. She was not only responsible for literary fiction and nonfiction but also for scholarly publications in Australian literary studies.

    <title>Get the music facts</title>
    <description>Art Facts: Music, a new digital resource from the Australia Council for the Arts, tells the story of music in numbers. It brings together facts, figures and research from across the music sector and, through an interactive website, will inspire people to discover and share facts about music, sparking quality debate.Art Facts: Music is structured around five key elements of the music ecosystem: creation; industry; global trade; participation; funding and public support. It brings together research from APRA | AMCOS, ARIA, PPCA, Live Performance Australia, Music Council of Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and others, allowing people to find it in one place and compare the figures in new ways.

“There’s a wealth of facts and figures on the music industry out there, but it’s in so many different locations – not all of which are readily known or accessible to everyone in the music sector,” says Kathy Keele, CEO of the Australia Council for the Arts. “Art Facts brings this together. It’s a rich resource for deepening our understanding of the sector learning more about its size, scope, issues and opportunities.”

“Art Facts: Music illustrates the enduring importance of the music industry to Australia both culturally and economically,” says Kathy. “And as new data is released, it can be added to Art Facts, creating a definitive gateway for research, facts and figures on the music industry.”

Matthew Hindson, Chair of the Australia Council Music Board says “there is a multitude of information here, a kaleidoscope of facts - each fact deserving its own analysis and provoking us to consider who makes music, who listens to it, who makes the money and who doesn’t.”

“You can really see the pervasiveness of music,” says Matthew. “Almost everyone makes music part of their everyday lives – as listeners or performers, as audience members and hobbyists - all of which makes music simultaneously remarkable and something that is easily taken for granted.”

“Art Facts: Music also demonstrates the resilience of the music industry, how it defies recent tougher financial times with Australian households spending $2 billion on music each year,” says Matthew. “Australians are buying 100 million recordings per year and live music brings over 42 million fans into Australia’s pubs and clubs.”

“The music industry itself is going through a consumer-lead digital revolution, with spending on digital music set to overtake CD sales in 2012 as fans buy more music online, and embrace subscription services.”

“Seeing the sheer size and scale of the music industry laid out is impressive,” says Matthew.&amp;nbsp; “But in stark contrast, the median creative income for professional musicians is only $7,200 a year.”

Music is the first sector to go under the spotlight in the Australia Council’s Art Facts project. The website will grow to include key facts about all artforms, with other artforms being added throughout 2013. Art Facts will become a permanent resource for learning more about Australian arts through data and analysis.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

    <title>Next Wave announced as JUMP Mentoring Industry Partner</title>
    <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

The Australia Council is excited to announce we will be partnering with Next Wave to deliver Jump Mentoring in 2013.

The newly expanded program supports creative practitioners in the early stages of their careers to work on an applied mentorship and creative project with a mentor who helps them jump to the next level.

Based in Melbourne, Next Wave supports emerging artists to take creative risks, establish critically-engaged professional practices and launch their work into a wider artistic and public domain through development programs and a curated biennial festival.

As the industry partner Next Wave will be delivering a dynamic mentorship induction and skills intensive for recipients of Jump and providing support throughout the duration of the mentorship.

&amp;#8220;We think this model of collaboration between industry and government is terrific; partly for how well it channels money directly to early career artists, and now - curators, editors, producers and collectives. This is a big moment for Next Wave. We are thrilled to be sharing our rigorous and sought-after development approach with more, and different, people.&amp;#8221; Emily Sexton, Artistic Director

Kath Melbourne, Program Director, ArtStart says &amp;#8220;The partnership represents the core strengths of both organisations. The Australia Council is providing its resources effectively to the robust tasks of application, assessment and acquittal while harnessing the talents of Next Wave to deliver timely, relevant and dynamic professional development opportunities to participants on the ground. We hope that this partnership gleans new networks and new opportunities for participants for years to come&amp;#8221;

    <title>Achievements in community arts celebrated</title>
    <description>Pioneering community and cultural artist Meme McDonald will be awarded the prestigious Ros Bower Award, worth $50,000, for an outstanding, life-long contribution to community arts and cultural development.The Kirk Robson Award will also be presented to Mohammed Ahmad and Anna Weekes. The $10,000 award recognises outstanding leadership from young people working in community arts and cultural development, particularly in the areas of reconciliation and social justice.

The awards are presented at the 2012 Australia Council Community Arts and Cultural Development Awards, held in Melbourne’s Abbotsford Convent tonight, an opportunity for the sector to gather and celebrate the inspiring work and excellent art from this field.

For over 30 years Meme McDonald has been working in community arts and cultural development as a director, writer, photographer, installation artist, author and filmmaker.

As founder of one of Australia’s first community theatres – West Theatre Company in the western suburbs of Melbourne in 1979 – and its artistic director for eight years, Meme has been one of Australia’s pioneers in the development of community based arts and the role of the professional artist.

Recently, she was artistic director for CONNECTING IDENTITIES, City of Geelong’s three year project as part of the national GENERATIONS project. Meme was also the artistic advisor of the national project. Her leadership role on this project encouraged artists working in Charters Towers in North Queensland, Liverpool in Western Sydney, La Trobe Valley and Wangaratta in regional Victoria, to tackle large issues of concern to their communities.

“As a community artist, Meme continues to lead the field with innovative projects and the influence of her practice on many artists is well recognised,” says Kathy Keele, CEO of the Australia Council.

”Whether working in circus tents, housing estates, or in a North Queensland Rainforest the work she does matters to communities and her ideas remain fresh, engaging and profound,” says Kathy.

Meme has a sustained commitment to working collaboratively with Indigenous communities, leaders, artists and elders; inviting Indigenous perspective and contribution wherever projects are based, not only in regionally based projects in Darwin, Katherine, Alice Springs, but where she lives and works in Melbourne.

Of significance is her 15 year collaboration with Aboriginal storyteller Boori Monty Pryor. Together they have authored six books with the involvement of elders, family members and community from the Kunggandji and Birri Gubba nations, Far North Queensland. These books have been groundbreaking in that they are collaborative works, community based, and have been published by Australia’s leading independent publisher, Allen and Unwin to critical acclaim.

Kirk Robson Award recipient Mohammed Ahmad is a community arts and cultural development artist, writer, editor and actor. He is chief editor of the BYDS literary program Westside Publications.

Mohammed is passionately dedicated to providing a voice to the people of Western Sydney and to get past the stereotypes that are often presented, particularly around Middle Eastern and Indigenous residents of the area.

In 2005 he revived Westside, the publication produced by BYDS, seeing its potential to make real change in the lives of young people from Southwest Sydney. Under Mohammed’s guidance it was transformed into the only publishing program in Australia that exclusively recognises the works of emerging and established Western Sydney artists.

Westside Publications produces ongoing literary anthologies including Westside Literary Journal and Westside Jr., as well as a number of performance events, video projects, workshops and residencies. Mohammed has produced events in the past six Sydney Writers’ Festivals and most recently edited the publication On Western Sydney, the second collection in a new series from Westside Publications.

“Mohammed recognised that the absence of voices from Western Sydney was a gap in the Australian literary landscape,” says Kathy Keele. “Through his publications, workshops and events he has fostered a literary culture in Western Sydney fuelled by the community itself.”

“As a cultural leader and role model he has instigated tangible change and we can expect the legacy of his extraordinary body of community based arts practice to have an impact well into the future.”

As an actor, Mohammed has performed in Urban Theatre Projects&amp;#39; Fast Cars and Tractor Engines (2004 -2005) and Stories of Love and Hate (2008 &amp;amp; 2011). He also performed in the Belvoir Theatre production I&amp;#39;m Your Man for the 2012 Sydney Festival.

Fellow Kirk Robson Award recipient is Darwin-based, Anna Weekes, whose work in community arts and cultural development has seen her working with some of the most vulnerable communities both here in Australia, and also in Vanuatu and Cambodia.

In Australia, Anna has been working with Darwin’s homeless population through projects like Ten Swags and Arts in the Long Grass, a fortnightly event where homeless people (long grassers) gather to eat a nutritious meal, create art and reconnect with their land. An annual exhibition of all of the artists is now an iconic event on the Darwin arts calendar.

Through these programs Anna works with the Aboriginal community at all levels – people diagnosed with mental health conditions, alcoholic and trauma-affected people, with elderly and frail people, with children and with established and emerging artists. Matching enthusiasm with empathy, she has provided a space for healing and reconnecting.

She has also worked with newly arrived refugees through projects including the My Sister’s Kitchen program, an increasingly successful food, art and craft program run with women and families who have recently been offered residency in Australia.

“One of the powerful attributes of Anna’s work is its humanising quality,” says Kathy. “Through her collaborations, we get to see the people whom are too often overlooked or, in some cases, treated with contempt.”

“A testament to the quality of her work is that many of her projects have continued to grow and flourish, long after she has moved on to new ones.”&amp;nbsp;

    <title>Celebrating 20 years of residencies with Time &amp;amp; Vision</title>
    <description>Over the past 20 years Acme Studios, London, has hosted 70 Australian artists in residence, supported by the Australia Council for the Arts, resulting in an extraordinary body of work and career building opportunities.Time &amp;amp; Vision is a major project celebrating this milestone; highlighting the range and vitality of contemporary Australian visual art through a publication, exhibition, film and online platform. It demonstrates how important it is to give artists time, space and resources to make new work in different surroundings.

Through personal testimonies from the artists, including&amp;nbsp; Aleks Danko, Sue Pedley, Fiona Hall, Sally Smart and Tom Polo; Time &amp;amp; Vision reveals how these residencies provided the participating artists with time to ‘develop new ideas and experiment’, the ‘luxury’ of thoroughly immersing themselves in research, offered ‘treasured moments’ and demonstrated how ‘a few months can support years of practice’.

“Turning the pages of the publication, it’s a pleasure to watch the residency program unfold over twenty years,” says Ted Snell, Chair of the Australia Council Visual Arts board. “The great benefit in artist residency programs is clear and perhaps best articulated in the words of Jo Flynn, who in the publication says, ‘what studios do, is allow a deep infection to set in: I’ve never quite shaken it’.”

Accompanying the Time &amp;amp; Vision publication is, an exhibition curated by Paul Bayley, presented at the Bargehouse on the Southbank, a perfect backdrop for the experimental and hybrid practices that are evident and strong in Australian visual arts.

New work includes: Paul Knight’s large-scale photographic pieces; a site-specific sculpture inspired by the building’s former use as a manufacturer of egg products by Lyndall Phelps; an audience participation painting performance piece by Tom Polo; Sally Smart will be creating a new wall piece; a performative video by Daniel von Sturmer; and a site-specific installation that incorporates ceramic sculptures and paintings by Michelle Ussher.

Artists recreating, showing recent work, or exhibiting works in London for the first time are Daniel Crooks, Nicole Ellis, Patrick Hartigan, Jacki Middleton, Vanilla Netto, Helen Pynor, Erica Seccombe, Renee So and Kathy Temin.

In 1992 the Australia Council became the first national cultural body to form an international residencies partnership with Acme Studios. The exhibition reflects the new internationalism showcasing Australian talent operating successfully overseas.

“The Australia Council for the Arts is delighted to support Acme in organising this unprecedented exploration of Australian artists work over the past twenty years. The publication is an important document of their achievements, creates the context for future discussion about artists residencies and makes visible what goes on behind studio doors,” Says Ted

“I would like to thank the artists whose creative vision has been at the core of Time &amp;amp; Vision, it’s been an honour to support a roll call of some of the most interesting Australian artists of our time.”
&amp;nbsp;

The Time &amp;amp; Vision publication is officially launched at the exhibition private view on Tuesday 23 October 2012, by His Excellency Mr. John Dauth AO LVO, High Commissioner for Australia. It is available for purchase through the Time &amp;amp; Vision online platform:

    <title>Australian arts and culture central in Asian Century</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts welcomes today&amp;#8217;s release of the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, by the Prime Minister Julia Gillard at the Lowy Institute.

The paper calls on all Australians to boost their understanding of our region&amp;#39;s history, culture and customs and urges a boost for Asian languages in Australia&amp;#39;s schools and universities. It lays out a series of pathways for Australian arts, artists and cultural institutions to play a pivotal role in building our relationships and networks across our region.

&amp;#8220;The Australia Council&amp;#8217;s engagement with Asia must increasingly build deep cultural interconnections between our nation and our neighbours,&amp;#8221; says Rupert Myer, Chair of the Australia Council. &amp;#8220;It is our view that the presence of Australian arts in Asia is a compelling sometimes underutilised asset that makes a substantial contribution to strengthening Australia&amp;#8217;s economic, political and cultural objectives.&amp;#8221;

&amp;#8220;The Australia Council works to build strong two way relationships over the long term &amp;shy;- the Council&amp;#8217;s relationships across the incredibly diverse region of Asia require sustained effort and investment,&amp;#8221; says Rupert. &amp;#8220;More and more, Australian artists are working with peers in Asia and we envisage new artistic collaborations and experiences.&amp;#8221;

The foundations have been well laid for the exchanges of artistic and cultural traditions between Australian and Asian artists and organisations, bolstered by investments in touring and artist residencies by the Australia Council and Asialink Arts among other agencies.

Australia&amp;#8217;s artists and arts companies &amp;#8211; across the performing arts, visual arts and literature &amp;#8211; have made strong inroads into the region&amp;#8217;s cultural markets and have developed an impressive network of relationships.

Kathy Keele, CEO of the Australia Council says, &amp;#8220;The opportunities for the arts and culture in Asia are not only for immediate market-driven outcomes but also enduring relationships grounded on reciprocity, cultural exchange and a sharing of aesthetic traditions and practices.&amp;#8221;

&amp;#8220;We welcome Arts Minister Crean&amp;#8217;s initiatives to lead even closer collaboration between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australia International Cultural Council, Screen Australia and other agencies to ensure we have a coordinated, highly visible impact across our region,&amp;#8221; says Kathy.

Rupert Myer concludes, &amp;#8220;Australia&amp;#8217;s arts and cultural sector will continue to deepen its connections with Asia&amp;#8217;s arts communities and audiences, and its large and expanding market. With established in-roads and growing expertise, the Australia Council welcomes the Government&amp;#8217;s focus on Asia and stands ready to contribute to the nation&amp;#8217;s objectives in the Asian Century.&amp;#8221;

    <title>Unique Indigenous story teller awarded</title>
    <description>Indigenous writer, poet and story teller Herb Wharton has been awarded the Australia Council Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature; a $50,000 award that recognises the achievements of eminent writers who have made outstanding and lifelong contributions to Australian literature.

Herb Wharton is a passionate advocate for Aboriginal literature and stories, for education and cultural understanding. He is a prominent speaker at national and international festivals and a lecturer in Australian Indigenous literature. He is a Life Member of the Australian Stockman&amp;#39;s Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre and a supporter of their Indigenous Heritage Project.

Coming to writing later in life, Herb presents a lifetime of experiences and a passion for recording the stories of the Aboriginal men and women and their role in the Australian pastoral industry. This has driven Herb Wharton&amp;#39;s development as a storyteller and a writer of international note.

&amp;#8220;Herb&amp;#39;s writing presents a unique and otherwise untold perspective of Australian rural heritage,&amp;#8221; says Sophie Cunningham, Chair of the Australia Council Literature Board. &amp;#8220;Through his stories, novels, poetry, notes, and collection of oral histories, Herb continues to ensure that stories of the Aboriginal contribution to the development of the Australian pastoral industry are told.&amp;#8221;

&amp;#8220;He is a wonderful advocate for Aboriginal literature and stories, as well as rural heritage more broadly,&amp;#8221; says Sophie. &amp;#8220;The importance of Herb&amp;#39;s work in documenting and telling these stories is reflected by the now 20 boxes of his writing, notes and recording of oral histories that are held in the University of Queensland&amp;#39;s Fryer Library.&amp;#8221;

His earlier career as a stockman drover and labourer had taken him across the Queensland outback. Since Herb began writing, he has furiously jotted down stories from his travels on scraps of paper; TAB forms, the backs of envelopes &amp;#8211; any blank paper at hand.

Herb wrote his first poem for musician Stan Coster, who went on to write many songs for Slim Dusty. The poem was written as a letter to answer Stan&amp;#39;s questions &amp;quot;about the past and the present&amp;#8223;. However, Herb quickly realised that this poem only gave rise to more unanswered questions, and so he began to write more poems to seek further answers about the land and the history of Aboriginal people.

At first he hid the poems because &amp;quot;it was a real shame job; you can&amp;#39;t show written stories to people.&amp;#8223; But after encouragement, in 1990, he entered several poems in a competition for unpublished Aboriginal writers, and as a result was commissioned to write a novel for the University of Queensland Press. The resulting book, 1992&amp;#39;s Unbranded, drew on Herb&amp;#39;s experiences as a stockman in the Australian interior.

He has since published Cattle Camp (1994) which is based on the true stories of Aboriginal stockmen and women, as well as a collection of short stories in Where Ya&amp;#39; Been, Mate? (1996). He has also published the semi-autobiography Yumba Days (1999), which was written during a residency at the Australia Council&amp;#39;s Paris studio. More recently, Herb has self-published a collection of poems, Kings with Empty Pockets (2003).

Herb is currently working on his next novel and has also recently purchased his home, a two-room &amp;quot;shack&amp;#8223; in Cunnamulla where he made his first notes and wrote his first novel. He aims to establish a trust, to ensure that his home will one day welcome and nurture visiting artists (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal) in outback Queensland.




  The Australia Council Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature
  presented Thursday 22 November in the Rover Thomas Auditorium at the Australia Council for the Arts
  5.00-7.00PM

  Chair of the Literature Board Sophie Cunningham&amp;#39;s speech at the ceremony is available to read here.

    <title>Vale Dame Elisabeth Murdoch</title>
    <description>The Australia Council joins family members, friends and the national community to mourn the death of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch.Dame Elisabeth has been one of Australia’s most active philanthropists and passionate supporters of the arts.

We take this moment to pause and reflect on her immense contribution to our national life which has been far reaching, spanning the arts and culture, health, education and community. &amp;nbsp;

Her lifelong commitment to the culture of our country has assisted Australian creativity in enumerable ways. Her giving was often discrete and ongoing.&amp;nbsp; She avoided the limelight and had an unflagging commitment to ensuring that talent is fostered and fully developed.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

A truly outstanding humanitarian, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch’s legacy will live on in the thousands of people her generosity has touched.

We extend our deepest sympathies to the Murdoch family and to Dame Elisabeth’s many friends. &amp;nbsp;

    <title>New Australia Council Director of Literature</title>
    <description>The Australia Council for the Arts today announced the appointment of Jill Eddington as its new Director of Literature. Previously the Director and CEO of the Byron Bay Writers Festival and Northern Rivers Writers’ Centre, Jill will commence her new role in January 2013.As Director of Literature, Jill will be responsible for providing leadership to the Australia Council’s Literature section and will be the senior advisor to its Literature Board, implementing its decisions and providing key links between the Australia Council, writers and the publishing sector.

“I am looking forward to joining new colleagues at the Australia Council for the Arts. The writing and publishing industry is in a state of transformation at the moment. I hope to work with the board to assist the sector to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities for writers and the vibrant literature sector in Australia,” said Jill.

Jill has worked extensively with the Literary Sector including, most recently, her role as curator of the Australian Society of Authors 50th Anniversary Program. She has also worked with the State Library of Queensland, Arts Northern Rivers and has consulted to the wider arts community. &amp;nbsp;

Susan’s dynamic leadership saw increased exposure for Australian writers through appearances at major writers’ festivals in Europe, Asia and North America. She also led important research into the publishing industry that ultimately led to major alterations in the way the Literature Board supports publishers. Her reforms were welcomed by Australian publishers.

Susan plans to retire following her career which has included positions at the Centre for Studies in Australian Literature at the University of Western Australia and on the literary journal Westerly. In 1996 she was appointed State Literature Officer for Western Australia.

    <title>New Geeks in Residence for arts organisations </title>
    <description>Four arts organisations will employ geeks who will share their passion for solving technological problems in creative environments, helping arts workers become better equipped to work in digital spaces.

Now in its third year, the Australia Council for the Arts’ Geek in Residence program supports organisations to employ geeks to deliver dynamic digital initiatives across their organisation and its community. The geeks provide skills, information and connections needed to succeed in the digital era.

“Geek in Residence is a really popular program because it’s not just about an external expert delivering a digital project and then leaving the building,” says Libby Christie Acting Chief Executive of the Australia Council. “The program provides intensive professional development for artists and the participating organisations in their own environment leaving a valuable legacy in terms of new organizational skills and digital capacity.&amp;quot;

Western Sydney’s Information and Cultural Exchange (ICE) are well known for working at the intersection of the arts, community cultural development and digital technology, but a recent technology audit found they were in need of some ‘geek know-how’ and a strategic approach to keeping the organisation up-to-date with rapidly changing technologies.

The Geek in Residence at ICE will work closely with ICE manager, producers and curatorial staff to build capacity within the organisation to engage in digital change. The geek will work across all aspects of the ICE’s activity from community development, creative enterprise, training marketing and promotion and operations.

At Arts Access Victoria a project lead by Akash Temple, an artist with a disability and a self-professed technology geek, will explore and promote the ways artists and audiences with a disability are using technology to overcome barriers to participation in arts and cultural activities.

The residency will ultimately deliver a fully-accessible digital publication produced by artists with a disability. The publication will outline available technology and how it can be used by producers and organisations to work with artists with a disability, and to engage audience members who have a disability.

A unique opportunity at Barkly Regional Arts (NT) in Tennant Creek will see a resident geek explore the interface of new media and Indigenous cultures in remote regional Australia. The geek will work within Barkly Arts as they focus on exploring how arts and culture in their communities can interact with cutting edge digital media.

Bell Shakespeare’s (NSW) geek will be the driving force behind a new online platform for inter-community exchange. A unique and advanced online interface will share the company’s touring stories as well as fostering dialogue between communities and the company. An additional component will enhance the company’s Learning Program with access to learning resources and virtual classroom activities extending the experience of their in-school program.


Some of the geek roles will be recruited during February.
Follow the Australia Council on Twitter @auscouncilarts and the hash tag #residentgeeks to keep up with all the latest geek activity.

    <title>Hon Simon Crean MP - Media release - Fiona Menzies to head up Creative Partnerships Australia</title>
    <description>The Hon Simon Crean MP

Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government
Minister for the Arts


Arts Minister Simon Crean today announced Ms Fiona Menzies as the first Chief Executive Officer of the new single agency to drive a new culture of giving and investment in Australia’s cultural sector.

Mr Crean said the new philanthropy and social investment agency for the cultural sector will be named Creative Partnerships Australia.

“Donation, social investment and business partnerships are already essential to the innovation and sustainability of the cultural industries in Australia, but there’s much more to be done,” Mr Crean said.

&amp;nbsp;“Creative Partnerships Australia is a crucial part of the strategy in the National Cultural Policy and I thank Mr Harold Mitchell who recommended this new approach in his 2012 Review of Private Sector Support for the Arts.

&amp;nbsp;“Creative Partnerships Australia has the responsibility for creating a new culture of giving and investment for the cultural industries in Australia by bringing donors, business, artists and cultural organisations together.

“A strong new agency requires strong and creative leadership and I welcome Ms Menzies to the role and look forward to her working together with Chair, Ms Carol Schwartz AM.

“Ms Menzies’ experience as Development Manager of Melbourne’s Wheeler Centre over the past three years, and her extensive background in arts policy provides the industry knowledge and innovative approach required to establish Creative Partnerships Australia.”

Chair of Creative Partnerships Australia, Ms Carol Schwartz AM said Ms Menzies is recognised within the industry as a strategic and insightful voice on cultural sector development and planning.

“She will be instrumental in leading Creative Partnerships Australia to encourage and support philanthropy and investment in the cultural industries.”

Ms Menzies said she was excited about the challenge of redefining the way the Australian cultural sector is supported, working in partnership with government, donors, investors and the community.

“Australia’s funding landscape is on the cusp of a generational change and I look forward to leading Creative Partnerships Australia to drive this change,” she said.

Mr Crean announced the creation of a single agency to replace the Australia Business Arts Foundation and Artsupport Australia in August last year.

“It is a very exciting time to be involved in supporting the cultural industries in Australia,” Mr Crean said.

“Private philanthropy and sponsorship is vital for the growth and durability of the cultural industries and enables artists and organisations to plan for the future and produce high-quality, challenging and relevant work.

“I thank the staff and management of AbaF and Artsupport for the hard work in creating a success story in driving new revenue streams for the sector and guiding the establishment of the new agency.”

Creative Partnerships Australia strengthens the Australian Government’s broader work in strengthening social investment in the not-for-profit sector and encouraging entrepreneurial skills across the economy.

Ms Menzies starts in the new role this week.

Australian singer-songwriter Gotye has created Australian music history at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, winning three awards, including for Best Record for his hit song Somebody That I Used to Know featuring Kimbra.

Gotye, real name Wouter (Wally) De Backer, is the first Australian to win multiple Grammys for the same release and only the second to win Best Record after Olivia Newton-John with ‘I Honestly Love You’ in 1975.

His album Making Mirrors took home the award for Best Alternative Music Album, while single Somebody That I Used to Know featuring Kimbra, won Best Record and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

After taking Australia by storm in 2011, the Federal Government provided Gotye with a $10,000 Australia Council grant to showcase his talents at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Arts Minister Simon Crean congratulated Gotye on his Grammy wins, as recognition of the overwhelming success and popularity of his winning single and album.

Gotye is an outstanding example of the quality of the artistic talent in Australia today and highlights the need for continued investment in young artists and musicians.

In recent years he has achieved much-deserved global recognition for his work, with Somebody That I Used to Know going platinum in Australia and the US, and achieving number one status in more than 18 countries.

At home he was recognised with six ARIA Awards in 2011.

Gotye will land in Canberra on Friday to join Minister Crean and officially open the Fractured Heart interactive sculpture at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia.

The event brings together school students to discuss film and music in a virtual roundtable using high-speed broadband.

Gotye will also launch Fractured Heart which he created with arts collective illuminart for his 2011 ARIA Awards performance of Somebody That I Used to Know.


Fractured Heart is on long-term loan to the National Film and Sound Archive.

    <title>Art in Festivals initiative calling for artists</title>
    <description>The Australia Council is pleased to announce that the SITUATE Art in Festivals initiative, which supports early career artists to develop experimental work within a festival environment, is now calling for artists to participate.
The $250,000 Art in Festivals initiative is part of a suite of residencies and mentorships supported through the Australia Council’s Early Career Artists and Producers Program and is part of the more than $7m invested by the Australia Council in Tasmanian arts in the past year. The initiative is delivered by Salamanca Arts Centre, who were awarded the project in December through a competitive application process.

Salamanca Arts Centre will partner with festivals to provide early career artists with an opportunity to present work at a range of major music and arts festivals across Australia and internationally.

“We’re pleased to work with Tasmania’s dynamic Salamanca Arts Centre on SITUATE,” says Acting CEO of the Australia Council Libby Christie. “Salamanca have developed a strong and diverse national – even international - network of festival partners offering participating artists high profile, exciting opportunities to engage with a vast range of audiences.”

Partner festivals include Dark Mofo and MONA FOMA, Darwin Festival, Harvest Music and Arts, Fringe World, WOMAdelade&amp;nbsp;as well as the international festival Vry Fees in South Africa. More partner festivals will be added throughout the initiative.

Artists participating in the initiative will have opportunities to test new ideas; collaborate with artists and technicians from different disciplines; work small and/or large scale in a site-specific context; and receive wide exposure and access to significant networks in the industry.

“SITUATE provides a chance for audiences from a diverse range of festivals to experience first-hand the best of Australian emerging and experimental practice,” says Libby Christie “For the artists, it’s an extraordinary opportunity to create new work, explore new ideas, discover different way of working and create challenging experimental art works for festival audiences.”

Fifteen early career artists, working across artforms and disciplines, will be selected through a national call by a Curatorium comprising of practicing artists, industry professionals and curators.&amp;nbsp;

These outstanding artists will then attend an intensive 16 day residential Artist Laboratory in Tasmania, which includes time at the closing weekend of the new winter Dark MOFO festival.

They will be mentored by established artists and producers as they develop their ideas and concepts and will then go through a commissioning process by partner festivals leading to the production and presentation of their work in 2014 and 2015.

Rosemary Miller, CEO and Artistic Director of Salamanca Arts Centre says, “This is a very exciting project that provides Early Career Artists with opportunities to create new works for multiple festivals, in Tasmania, across Australia and internationally.





  Applications open Monday 25 March 2013 for 2 weeks, closing on Monday 8 April 2013 via the SITUATE: Art in Festivals website.

    <title>Vale James Strong AO</title>
    <description>The Australia Council mourns the death in Sydney on Sunday 3 March 2013 of its former Chair Mr James Strong AO.

James Strong led the Australia Council as its Chair from 2006 to 2012. He was a passionate and highly respected advocate for the arts, blending business acumen with a love for arts and culture.

Prior to becoming Chair of the Australia Council, Mr Strong played an active leadership role in the arts. He made a significant contribution to the sector, serving on many arts company boards. He was a director of Opera Australia, Chair of the Sydney Theatre Company, Chair of Australian Brandenburg Orchestra and Chair of the Australia Business Arts Foundation.

Mr Strong led the 2005 Orchestras Review, which resulted in the orchestras’ independence from the ABC, establishment as statutory bodies and increased investment from the federal government. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2006 for services to business and to the arts, as an administrator and as a philanthropist.

‘I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of James Strong. He has made an enduring contribution to the arts in Australia and will be missed by the Australian arts sector,’ said Australia Council Chair Mr Rupert Myer AM. ‘James brought a dynamic combination of corporate experience and deep passion for the arts. He was a great friend to Australia’s artists and a distinguished cultural leader.’

    <title>Simon Mordant appointed Venice Biennale Commissioner for 2015</title>
    <description>Mr Rupert Myer AM, Chair of the Australia Council for the Arts, today announced the appointment of Mr Simon Mordant AM as Commissioner for the Australian exhibition at the 56th National Art Exhibition, Venice Biennale 2015. The announcement has been made today ahead of the Australia Council’s annual Visual Arts Award ceremony at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia in Sydney this evening.

Mr Mordant is currently the Commissioner for the 2013 Australian Venice Biennale exhibition, which commences in June this year when a solo show of the work of artist Simryn Gill, curated by Catherine de Zegher will open in the Australian Pavilion at the 55th National Art Exhibition.

Prior to the 2013 Biennale, Mr Mordant was Deputy Commissioner to Mr Doug Hall at the 2011 Venice Biennale, when an exhibition of work by artist Hany Armanious attracted more than 190,000 visitors to Australia’s national pavilion.

“We are very pleased to re-appoint Simon Mordant to the role of Commissioner,” says Mr Rupert Myer. “The Australia Council has managed Australia’s representation at the Venice Biennale for more than 30 years and the appointment of a dynamic commissioner underpins a successful Australian exhibition. The role of commissioner is vital to driving advocacy and fundraising programs around our participation in each Biennale and Simon has an impressive track record in these endeavours.”

“Simon’s dedication to the arts is unquestionable and his commitment to the Venice Biennale in particular has been extraordinary,” says Mr Myer. “As Commissioner, Simon continues to play a high profile role fostering international interest in Australian artists.”

A committed supporter of the arts, Mr Mordant is the Chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA). Earlier, as Chairman of the MCA Foundation, he was pivotal in driving fundraising for the Museum’s major $53 million redevelopment and expansion project. He is currently leading the fundraising for the development of the new Australian Pavilion in Venice.

Mr Mordant also sits on the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), the Sydney Theatre Company, the Leadership Council for the New Museum in New York, and is a member of the Executive Committee of the Tate International Council and a member of the International Council of The Museum of Modern Art in New York.

“I’m absolutely delighted to continue working with the Australia Council to deliver the Australian representation at the Venice Biennale,” says Mr Mordant. “Behind this showcase is an important public/private partnership and I am passionate about continuing to strengthen Australia’s representation at Venice.

“2015 will be a very important year for Australia with the planned opening of the new Australian Pavilion - the only 21st century building in the Biennale gardens. The world will be focussed on Australia and I am honoured to accept this role of Commissioner at this time,” he says.

The Biennale is considered the most important and prestigious event on the international contemporary art calendar. Australia’s long history of representation at the Venice Biennale began in 1954 with the exhibition of Sidney Nolan’s iconic works, followed by renowned artists including; Arthur Boyd, Rosalie Gascoigne and Albert Tucker. Recent Australian representatives include: Imants Tillers (1986), Judy Watson, Emily Kame Kngwarreye (1997), Howard Arkley (1999), Patricia Piccinini (2003), Ricky Swallow (2005), Susan Norrie, Daniel Von Sturmer and Callum Morton (2007), Shaun Gladwell (2009) and Hany Armanious (2011).




  The 2013 Venice Biennale featuring Simryn Gill’s Here art grows on trees opens to the public on 1 June and continues until 24 November.

    <title>Leading artist and curator win major visual arts awards</title>
    <description>Tracey Moffatt, one of Australia’s leading internationally acclaimed contemporary artists, and Juliana Engberg, Artistic Director of the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA) in Melbourne and Artistic Director of the forthcoming Biennale of Sydney; are being honoured today for their achievements in the arts with the Australia Council Visual Arts Award and Medal respectively.

Since her groundbreaking Something More exhibition, presented at the Australian Centre for Photography in 1989, Tracey Moffatt’s work has featured in more than 100 solo exhibitions across Europe, the USA and Australia. Her work is held in the collections of some of the world’s most prestigious art museums and galleries including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Guggenheim, Centre Pompidou and the Tate Gallery. Many of her photographs and short films have achieved iconic status both in Australia and around the world.

&amp;quot;Tracey Moffatt’s outstanding contribution to the cultural life of this nation has been acknowledged with the 2012 Australia Council Visual Arts Award,&amp;quot; says Mr Rupert Myer AM, Chair of the Australia Council, who is presenting the $40,000 award at an award ceremony at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Sydney this evening.

&amp;quot;Tracey’s work has been critically acclaimed internationally for more than two decades, following the selection of her short film Night Cries for official competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival,&amp;quot; says Mr Myer. &amp;quot;More recently, she was recognised with a solo exhibition of her films and videos at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;During the intervening decades Tracey’s career has been defined by an extraordinary list of achievements. She more than fulfils the criteria of the Award to ‘inspire Australians’ through her her compelling and dynamic practice,&amp;quot; he says.

Juliana Engberg receives the $10,000 Medal for her outstanding contribution to the development of the Australian cultural sector. In a career spanning nearly 30 years of curating, teaching, talking and writing about art, Juliana Engberg continues to be at the forefront of contemporary curatorial practice. As well as curating over 400 exhibitions, she is a prolific writer and editor, having written over 1,500 articles about contemporary art in catalogues, books and journals. She is one of Australia’s most accomplished public commentators on contemporary art.

&amp;quot;Few individuals have made such a distinguished contribution to the development of the Australian visual arts sector as Juliana Engberg,&amp;quot; says Mr Myer. &amp;quot;As a curator and advocate for Australian art she has taken the work of Australian artists to the world and brought the best of international practice back to Australia.

&amp;quot;As Artistic Director of the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA), in Melbourne since 2002, Juliana has brought a keen intellect and distinctive eye to the curatorial process that has enlivened the cultural scene in this country and simultaneously advanced the careers of many Australian artists&amp;quot;.

Both Engberg and Moffatt will be honoured at a ceremony at the MCA at 6PM this evening, surrounded by arts sector leaders and close family and friends. A key note address will be delivered by philanthropist and Chief Commissioner of the Venice Biennale, Simon Mordant AM.

    <title>New investment in Australian creativity</title>
    <description>Rupert Myer AM, Chair of the Australia Council for the Arts has today welcomed the launch of the National Cultural Policy and response to the recommendations of the Australia Council review.

Speaking from the National Press Club in Canberra, where Minister for the Arts The Hon Simon Crean MP launched the policy, Mr Rupert Myer said, &amp;#39;The development and delivery of the National Cultural Policy, Creative Australia, symbolises the importance of the arts to a vibrant, innovative and healthy Australia. It is an opportunity to reposition artists and creativity at the centre of Australian life.&amp;#39;

&amp;#39;Creative Australia embodies the principle that the arts are for everyone, and experienced in many ways in every community – from Indigenous arts and cultures across the country, to opera on the harbour, blockbuster exhibitions in our galleries, and local performing arts centres,&amp;#39; Mr Myer said.

The Policy presents a national framework for the arts, culture and creativity; providing Australia with a set of strategic directions, initiatives and themes.

&amp;#39;This is an opportunity to ensure artists and Australian creativity are recognised, valued and celebrated for the immense contribution they make to our nation and society. It is an historic juncture to be seized – where digital technology and the global creative community and market place are expanding artistic horizons beyond anything we have seen in the past.

&amp;#39;The Australia Council is delighted that Creative Australia positions our organisation as a pivotal driver of the nation’s cultural future,&amp;#39; said Mr Myer.

Creative Australia includes the Government’s response to the review of the Australia Council. Initiated in 2011, the review affirmed the inaugural Chair Mr H.C &amp;#39;Nugget&amp;#39; Coombs&amp;#39; original vision for the Australia Council as relevant today, but recommended that the Council’s enabling legislation and governance be updated to reflect the Council’s place in 21st century Australia.

Included in the response to the recommendations is a $75.3 million increase to funding to the Australia Council over four years. This additional funding is chiefly in aid of its core responsibility to support more artists who have achieved excellence in practice.

&amp;#39;The Australia Council receives applications from more high-quality artists today than ever before, some of them working in ways not imagined 10 years ago. This increased funding is welcomed as it represents a significant further investment in artistic excellence of this kind,&amp;#39; Mr Myer said.

&amp;#39;The response to the Australia Council review also provides a timely opportunity to remake the institution to fit the times. Modernised legislation will clarify functions and remove constraints, providing Council with greater flexibility to engage more artistic expertise to assist its planning and decisions. Importantly, the new legislation also confirms that Council’s decisions on arts funding are made at arms’ length from government.

&amp;#39;Four decades after the establishment of the Australia Council I believe the changes outlined in this announcement offer the Australia Council a new flexibility, new tools, better interconnectivity and ways of meeting the challenges and securing the opportunities that lay ahead,&amp;#39; Mr Myer said.

&amp;#39;The Australia Council looks forward to a continuing dialogue with the sector as we implement the adopted review recommendations,&amp;#39; he concluded.
